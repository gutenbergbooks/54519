<h2>NAPLES.</h2>

<p>On the tenth day of this month we arrived
early at Naples, for I think it was
about two o’clock in the morning; and sure
the providence of God preserved us, for never
was such weather seen by me since I came into
the world; thunder, lightning, storm at sea,
rain and wind, contending for mastery, and
combining to extinguish the torches bought
to light us the last stage: Vesuvius, vomiting
fire, and pouring torrents of red hot lava down
its sides, was the only object visible; and
<em>that</em> we saw plainly in the afternoon thirty
miles off, where I asked a Franciscan friar,
If it was the famous volcano? “Yes,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
he, “that’s our mountain, which throws up
money for us, by calling foreigners to see the
extraordinary effects of so surprising a phænomenon.”
The weather was quiet then,
and we had no notion of passing such a horrible
night; but an hour after dark, a storm
came on, which was really dreadful to endure;
or even look upon: the blue lightning, whose
colour shewed the nature of the original minerals
from which she drew her existence,
shone round us in a broad expanse from time
to time, and sudden darkness followed in an
instant: no object then but the fiery river
could be seen, till another flash discovered the
waves tossing and breaking, at a height I
never saw before.</p>

<p>Nothing sure was ever more sublime or
awful than our entrance into Naples at the
dead hour we arrived, when not a whisper was
to be heard in the streets, and not a glimpse
of light was left to guide us, except the small
lamp hung now and then at a high window
before a favourite image of the Virgin.</p>

<p>My poor maid had by this time nearly
lost her wits with terror, and the French
valet, crushed with fatigue, and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
with rain and sea-spray, had just life enough
left to exclaim&mdash;“<i lang="fr">Ah, Madame! il me semble
que nous sommes venus icy exprès pour voir la
fin du monde</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.”</p>

<p>The Ville de Londres inn was full,
and could not accommodate our family;
but calling up the people of the Crocelle,
we obtained a noble apartment, the windows
of which look full upon the celebrated
bay which washes the wall at our
door. Caprea lies opposite the drawing-room
or gallery, which is magnificent; and my
bed-chamber commands a complete view of
the mountain, which I value more, and which
called me the first night twenty times away
from sleep and supper, though never so in
want of both as at that moment surely.</p>

<p>Such were my first impressions of this wonderful
metropolis, of which I had been always
reading summer descriptions, and had regarded
somehow as an Hesperian garden, an earthly
paradise, where delicacy and softness subdued
every danger, and general sweetness captivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
every sense;&mdash;nor have I any reason yet to
say it will not still prove so, for though wet,
and weary, and hungry, we wanted no fire,
and found only inconvenience from that they
lighted on our arrival. It was the fashion at
Florence to struggle for a Terreno, but here
we are all perched up one hundred and forty
two steps from the level of the land or sea;
large balconies, apparently well secured, give
me every enjoyment of a prospect, which no
repetition can render tedious: and here we
have agreed to stay till Spring, which, I trust,
will come out in this country as soon as the
new year calls it.</p>

<p>Our eagerness to see sights has been repressed
at Naples only by finding every thing
a sight; one need not stir out to look for wonders
sure, while this amazing mountain continues
to exhibit such various scenes of sublimity
and beauty at exactly the distance one
would chuse to observe it from; a distance
which almost admits examination, and certainly
excludes immediate fear. When in
the silent night, however, one listens to its
groaning; while hollow sighs, as of gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sorrow, are often heard distinctly in my apartment;
nothing can surpass one’s sensations of
amazement, except the consciousness that custom
will abate their keenness: I have not,
however, yet learned to lie quiet, when columns
of flame, high as the mountain’s self,
shoot from its crater into the clear atmosphere
with a loud and violent noise; nor shall I ever
forget the scene it presented one day to my
astonished eyes, while a thick cloud, charged
heavily with electric matter, passing over, met
the fiery explosion by mere chance, and went
off in such a manner as effectually baffles all
verbal description, and lasted too short a time
for a painter to seize the moment, and imitate
its very strange effect. Monsieur de Vollaire,
however, a native of France, long resident in
this city, has obtained, by perpetual observation,
a power of representing Vesuvius without
that black shadow, which others have thought
necessary to increase the contrast, but which
greatly takes away all resemblance of its original.
Upon reflection it appears to me, that
the men most famous at London and Paris for
performing tricks with fire have been always
Italians in my time, and commonly Neapolitans;
no wonder, I should think, Naples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
would produce prodigious connoisseurs in
this way; we have almost perpetual lightning
of various colours, according to the
soil from whence the vapours are exhaled;
sometimes of a pale straw or lemon colour,
often white like artificial flame produced by
camphor, but oftenest blue, bright as the rays
emitted through the coloured liquors set in
the window of a chemist’s shop in London&mdash;and
with such thunder!!&mdash;“For God’s sake,
Sir,” said I to some of them, “is there no danger
of the ships in the harbour here catching fire?
why we should all fly up in the air directly, if
once these flashes should communicate to the
room where any of the vessels keep their
powder.”&mdash;“Gunpowder, Madam!” replies
the man, amazed; “why if St. Peter and St.
Paul came here with gunpowder on board, we
should soon drive them out again: don’t you
know,” added he, “that every ship discharges
her contents at such a place (naming it), and
never comes into our port with a grain on
board?”</p>

<p>The palaces and churches have no share in
one’s admiration at Naples, who scorns to depend
on man, however mighty, however skilful,
for <em>her</em> ornaments; while Heaven has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
bestowed on her and her <i lang="it">contorni</i> all that can
excite astonishment, all that can impress awe.
We have spent three or four days upon Pozzuoli
and its environs; its cavern scooped originally
by nature’s hand, assisted by the armies
of Cocceius Nerva&mdash;ever tremendous, ever
gloomy grotto!&mdash;which leads to the road that
shews you Ischia, an old volcano, now an
island apparently rent asunder by an earthquake,
the division too plain to beg assistance
from philosophy: this is commonly called the
<i lang="it">Grotto di Posilippo</i> though; you pass through
it to go to every place; not without flambeaux,
if you would go safely, and avoid the
necessity the poor are under, who, driving
their carts through the subterranean passage,
cry as they meet each other, to avoid jostling,
<i lang="it">alla montagna</i>, or <i lang="it">alla marina</i>, <em>keep to the rock
side</em>, or <em>keep to the sea side</em>. It is at the right
hand, awhile before you enter this cavern, that
climbing up among a heap of bushes, you find
a hollow place, and there go down again&mdash;it is
the tomb of Virgil; and, for other antiquities,
I recollect nothing shewed me when at Rome
that gave me as complete an idea how things
were really carried on in former days, as does
the temple of <em>Shor Apis</em> at Pozzuoli, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the area is exactly all it ever was; the ring
remains where the victim was fastened to; the
priests apartments, lavatories, &amp;c. the drains
for carrying the beast’s blood away, all yet
remains as perfect as it is possible. The end
of Caligula’s bridge too, but that they say is
not his bridge, but a mole built by some succeeding
emperor&mdash;a madder or a wickeder it
could not be&mdash;though here Nero bathed, and
here he buried his mother Agrippina. Here
are the centum camera, the prisons employed
by that prince for the cruellest of purposes;
and here are his country palaces reserved for
the most odious ones: here effeminacy learned
to subsist without delicacy or shame, hence
honour was excluded by rapacity, and conscience
stupefied by constant inebriation: here
brainsick folly put nature and common sense
upon the rack&mdash;Caligula in madness courted
the moon to his embraces&mdash;and Sylla, satiated
with blood, retired, and gave a premature banquet
to those worms he had so often fed with
the flesh of innocence: here dwelt depravity
in various shapes, and here Pandora’s chambers
left scarcely a <em>Hope</em> at the bottom that better
times should come:&mdash;who can write prose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
however in such places!&mdash;let the impossibility
of expressing my thoughts any other way excuse
the following</p>

<p>When one has exhausted all the ideas presented
to the mind by the sight of Monte
Nuovo, made in one night by the eruption of
Solfa Terra, now sunk into itself and almost
extinguished; by the lake Avernus; by the
Phlegræan fields, where Jupiter killed the
giants, with such thunderbolts as fell about our
ears the other night I trust, and buried one of
them alive under mount Ætna; when one has
seen the Sybil’s grott, and the Elysian plains,
and every seat of fable and of verse; when one
has run about repeating Virgil’s verses and
Claudian’s by turns, and handled the hot
sand under the cool waves of Baia; when one
has seen Cicero’s villa and Diana’s temple, and
talked about antiquities till one is afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
one’s own pedantry, and tired of every one’s
else; it is almost time to recollect realities of
more near interest to such of us as are not
ashamed of being Christians, and to remember
that it was at Pozzuoli St. Paul arrived
after the storms he met with in these seas.
The wind is still called here <i lang="it">Sieuroc</i>, o sia
<i lang="it">lo vento Greco</i>; and their manner of pronouncing
it led me to think it might possibly
be that called in Scripture <em>Euroc</em>lydon, abbreviated
by that grammatical figure, which lops
off the concluding syllables. The old Pastor
Patrobas too, who received and entertained
the Apostle here, lies interred under the altar
of an old church at Pozzuoli, made out of the
remains of a temple to Jupiter, whose pillars
are in good preservation: I was earnest to see
the place at least, as every thing named in the
New Testament is of true importance, but
one meets few people of the same taste: for
Romanists take most delight in venerating
traditionary heroes, and Calvinists, perhaps
too easily disgusted, desire to venerate no
heroes at all.</p>

<p>Some curious inscriptions here, to me not
legible, shew how this poor country has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
overwhelmed by tyrants, earthquakes, Saracens!
not to mention the Goths and Vandals,
who however left no traces <em>but</em> desolation:
while, as the prophet Joel says, “<cite>The ground
was as the garden of Eden before them, and
behind them a desolate wilderness</cite>.”</p>

<p>These Mahometan invaders, less savage, but
not less cruel, afforded at least an unwilling shelter
in that which is now their capital, for the
wretched remains of literature. To their
misty envelopement of science, fatigued with
struggling against perpetual suffocation, succeeded
imposture, barbarism, and credulity;
with superstition at their head, who still
keeps her footing in this country: and inspires
such veneration for St. Januarius, his
name, his blood, his statue, &amp;c. that the
Neapolitans, who are famous for blasphemous
oaths, and a facility of taking the most sacred
words into their mouths on every, and I may
say, on <em>no</em> occasion, are never heard to repeat
<em>his</em> name without pulling off their hat, or
making some reverential sign of worship at
the moment. And I have seen Italians from
other states greatly shocked at the grossness of
these their unenlightened neighbours, particularly
the half-Indian custom of burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
figures upon their skins with gunpowder:
these figures, large, and oddly displayed too,
according to the coarse notions of the wearer.</p>

<p>As the weather is exceedingly warm, and
there is little need of clothing for comfort, our
Lazaroni have small care about appearances,
and go with a vast deal of their persons uncovered,
except by these strange ornaments.
The man who rows you about this lovely
bay, has perhaps the angel Raphael, or the
blessed Virgin Mary, delineated on one
brawny sun-burnt leg, the saint of the town
upon the other: his arms represent the Glory,
or the seven spirits of God, or some strange
things, while a brass medal hangs from his
neck, expressive of his favourite martyr: whom
they confidently affirm is so madly venerated
by these poor uninstructed mortals, that when
the mountain burns, or any great disaster
threatens them, they beg of our Saviour to
speak to St. Januarius in their behalf, and
intreat him not to refuse them his assistance.
Now though all this was told me by friends
of the Romish persuasion; and told me too
with a just horror of the superstitious folly;
I think my remarks and inferences were not
agreeable to them, when expressing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
notion that it was only a relick of the adoration
originally paid to Janus in Italy, where
the ground yielding up its frost to the soft
breath of the new year, is not ill-typified by
the liquefaction of the blood; a ceremony
which has succeeded to various Pagan ones
celebrated by Ovid in the first book of his
Fasti. We know from history too, that perfumes
were offered in <em>January</em> always, to
signify the renovation of <em>sweets</em>; and this
was so necessary, that I think Tacitus tells us
Thrasea was first impeached for absence at
the time of the new year, when in <em>Janus</em>’s
presence, &amp;c. good wishes were formed for
the Emperor’s felicity; and no word of ill
omen was to be pronounced.&mdash;<i lang="la">Cautum erat
apud Romanos ne quod mali ominis verbum
calendis <em class="antiqua">Januariis</em> efferretur</i>; says Pliny:
and the <i lang="la">strenæ</i> or new-years gifts, called
now by the French “les <i lang="fr">etrennes</i>,” and
practised by Lutherans as well as Romanists,
is the self-same veneration of old <em>Janus</em>, if
fairly traced up to Tatius King of the Sabines,
who sought a laurel bough plucked
from the grove of the goddess <em>Strenia</em>, or
<em>Strenua</em>, and presented it to his favourites on
the first of <em>January</em>, from whence the custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
arose; and Symmachus, in his tenth book,
twenty-eighth epistle, mentions it clearly
when writing to the Emperors Theodosius
and Arcadius&mdash;“<i lang="la"><em class="antiqua">Strenuarum</em> usus adolevit
auctoritate Tatii regis, qui verbenas felicis
arboris ex luco Strenuæ anni</i>.”</p>

<p>Octavius Cæsar took the name of Augustus
on the first of January in Janus’s temple, by
Plancus’s advice, as a lucky day; and I suppose
our new-year’s ode, sung before the
King of England, may be derived from the
same source. The old Fathers of the Church
declaimed aloud against the custom of new-years
gifts, because they considered them as
of Pagan original. So much for <i lang="fr">Les Etrennes</i>.</p>

<p>As to <em>St. Januarius</em>, there certainly was
a martyr of that name at Naples, and to him was
transferred much of the veneration originally
bestowed on the deity from whom he was
probably named. One need not however wander
round the world with Banks and Solander,
or stare so at the accounts given us in Cook’s
Voyages of <em>tattowed Indians</em>, when Naples
will shew one the effects of a like operation,
very <em>very</em> little better executed, on the broad
shoulders of numberless Lazaroni; and of this
there is no need to examine books for information,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he who runs over the Chiaja may
read in large characters the gross superstition
of the Napolitani, who have no inclination
to lose their old classical character for laziness&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">says Ovid. I wonder however whether our
people would work much surrounded by
similar circumstances; I fancy not: Englishmen,
poor fellows! must either work or
starve; these folks want for nothing: a house
would be an inconvenience to them; they
like to sleep out of doors, and it is plain they
have small care for clothing, as many who
possess decent habiliments enough, I speak
of the Lazaroni, throw almost all off till some
holiday, or time of gala, and sit by the sea-side
playing at moro with their fingers.</p>

<p>A Florentine nobleman told me once, that
he asked one of these fellows to carry his
portmanteau for him, and offered him a <i lang="it">carline</i>,
no small sum certainly to a Neapolitan,
and rather more in proportion than an English
shilling; he had not twenty yards to go
with it: “<cite>Are you hungry, Master?</cite>” cries
the fellow. “<cite>No</cite>,” replied Count Manucci,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“<cite>but what of that?</cite>”&mdash;“<cite>Why then no more
am I</cite>:” was the answer, “<cite>and it is too hot
weather to carry burthens</cite>:” so turned about
upon the other side, and lay still.</p>

<p>This class of people, amounting to a number
that terrifies one but to think on, some
say sixty thousand souls, and experience
confirms no less, give the city an air of
gaiety and cheerfulness, and one cannot help
honestly rejoicing in. The Strada del Toledo
is one continual crowd: nothing can exceed
the confusion to a walker, and here are little
gigs drawn by one horse, which, without any
bit in his mouth, but a string tied round his
nose, tears along with inconceivable rapidity a
small narrow gilt chair, set between the two
wheels, and no spring to it, nor any thing
else which can add to the weight; and this
flying car is a kind of <i lang="it">fiacre</i> you pay so much
for a drive in, I forget the sum.</p>

<p>Horses are particularly handsome in this
town, not so large as at Milan, but very
beautiful and spirited; the cream-coloured
creatures, such as draw our king’s state coach,
are a common breed here, and shine like
sattin: here are some too of a shining silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
white, wonderfully elegant; and the ladies
upon the Corso exhibit a variety scarcely credible
in the colour of their cattle which draw
them: but the coaches, harness, trappings,
&amp;c. are vastly inferior to the Milanese, whose
liveries are often splendid; whereas the four
or five ill-dressed strange-looking fellows that
disgrace the Neapolitan equipages seem to be
valued only for their number, and have very
often much the air of Sir John Falstaff’s recruits.</p>

<p>Yesterday however shewed me what I
knew not had existed&mdash;a skew-ball or pye-balled
ass, eminently well-proportioned,
coated like a racer in an English stud, sixteen
hands and a half high, his colour bay and
white in large patches, and his temper, as the
proprietor told me, singularly docile and
gentle. I have longed perhaps to purchase
few things in my life more earnestly than
this beautiful and useful animal, which I
might have had too for two pounds fifteen
shillings English, but dared not, lest like
Dogberry I should have been written down
for an ass by my merry country folks, who,
I remember, could not let the Queen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
England herself possess in peace a creature
of the same kind, but handsomer still, and
from a still hotter climate, called the Zebra.</p>

<p>Apropos to quadrupeds, when Portia, in
the Merchant of Venice, enumerates her
lovers, she names the Neapolitan prince first;
who, she says, does nothing, for his part, but
talk of his horse, and makes it his greatest
boast that he can shoe him himself. This is
almost literally true of a nobleman here; and
they really do not throw their pains away;
for it is surprising to see what command they
have their cattle in, though bits are scarcely
used among them.</p>

<p>The coat armour of Naples consists of an
unbridled horse; and by what I can make
out of their character, they much resemble
him;</p>

to stop. No authority is respected by them
when some strong passion animates them to
fury: yet lazily quiet, and unwilling to stir
till accident rouses them to terror, or rage
urges them forward to incredible exertions of
suddenly-bestowed strength. In the eruption
of 1779, their fears and superstitions rose to
such a height, that they seized the French
ambassador upon the bridge, tore him almost
out of his carriage as he fled from Portici,
and was met by them upon the Ponte
della Maddalena, where they threatened him
with instant death if he did not get out of
his carriage, and prostrating himself before
the statue of St. Januarius, which stands there,
intreat his protection for the city. All this,
however, Mons. le Comte de Clermont D’Amboise
did not comprehend a word of; but taking
all the money out of his pocket, threw
it down, happily for him, at the feet of the
figure, and pacified them at once, gaining
time by those means to escape their vengeance.</p>

<p>It was, I think, upon some other occasion
that Sir William Hamilton’s book relates their
unworthy treatment of the venerable Archbishop,
who refused them the relicks with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
which they had no doubt of saving the menaced
town; but every time Vesuvius burns
with danger to the city, they scruple not to
insult their Sovereign as he flies from it;
throwing large stones after his chariot, guards,
&amp;c.; making the insurrection, it is sure to
occasion, more perilous, if possible, than the
volcano itself. And last night when <i lang="it">La Montagna
fu cattiva</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, as their expression was,
our Laquais de Place observed that it might
possibly be because so many hereticks and unbelievers
had been up it the day before.
“Oh! let us,” as King David wisely chose,
“fall into the hands of God&mdash;not into those of
man.”</p>

<p>I wished exceedingly to purchase here the
genuine account of Massaniello’s far-famed
sedition and revolt, more dreadful in a certain
way than any of the earthquakes which have
at different times shaken this hollow-founded
country. But my friends here tell me it was
suppressed, and burned by the hands of the
common executioner, with many chastisements
beside bestowed upon the writer, who
tried to escape, but found it more prudent
to submit to justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Agnello was the unluckily-adapted
name of the mad fisherman who headed the
mob on that truly memorable occasion: but
it is not an unusual thing here to cut off the
first syllable, and by the figure aphæresis alter
the appellation entirely. By that device of
dropping the <em>to</em>, he has been called Massaniello;
and this is one of their methods to
render the patois of Naples as unintelligible to
us, as if we had never seen Italy till now;
and one is above all things tormented with
their way of pronouncing names. Here are
Don and Donna again at this town as at Milan
however, because the King of Spain, or
<i lang="it">Ré Cattolico</i>, as these people always call him,
has still much influence; and they seem to
think nearly as respectfully of him as of their
own immediate sovereign, who is however
greatly beloved among them; and so he
ought to be, for he is the representative of
them all. He rides and rows, and hunts the
wild boar, and catches fish in the bay, and
sells it in the market, as dear as he can too;
but gives away the money they pay him for
it, and that directly: so that no suspicion of
meanness, or of any thing worse than a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rough merriment can be ever attached to his
truly-honest, open, undesigning character.</p>

<p>Stories of monarchs seldom give me pleasure, who
seldom am persuaded to give credit to
tales told of persons few people have any
access to, and whose behaviour towards
those few is circumscribed within the laws of
insipid and dull routine; but this prince lives
among his subjects with the old Roman
idea of a window before his bosom I believe.
They know the worst of him is that he shoots
at the birds, dances with the girls, eats macaroni,
and helps himself to it with his fingers,
and rows against the watermen in the
bay, till one of them burst out o’bleeding at
the nose last week, with his uncourtly efforts to
outdo the King, who won the trifling wager
by this accident: conquered, laughed, and
leaped on shore amidst the acclamations of the
populace, who huzzaed him home to the palace,
from whence he sent double the sum he
had won to the waterman’s wife and children,
with other tokens of kindness. Mean
time, while he resolves to be happy himself,
he is equally determined to make no man
miserable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Emperor and the Grand Duke
talked to him of their new projects for reformation
in the church, he told them he saw
little advantage they brought into <em>their</em> states
by these new-fangled notions; that when he
was at Florence and Milan, the deuce a Neapolitan
could he find in either, while his capital
was crowded with refugees from thence;
that in short they might do <em>their</em> way, but he
would do his; that he had not now an enemy
in the world, public or private; and that he
would not make himself any for the sake of
propagating doctrines he did not understand,
and would not take the trouble to study: that
he should say his prayers as he used to do,
and had no doubt of their being heard, while
he only begged blessings on his beloved people.
So if these wise brothers-in-law would
learn of him to enjoy life, instead of shortening
it by unnecessary cares, he invited them
to see him the next morning play a great
match at tennis.</p>

<p>The truth is, the jolly Neapolitans lead a coarse
life, but it is an unoppressed one. Never sure
was there in any town a greater shew of
abundance: no settled market in any given
place, I think, but every third shop full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
what the French call so properly <i lang="fr">ammunition de
Bouche</i>, while whole boars, kids and small
calves dangle from a sort of neat scaffolding,
all with their skins on, and make a pretty appearance.
Poulterers hang up their animals
in the feathers too, not lay them on boards
plucked, as at London or Venice.</p>

<p>The Strada del Toledo is at least as long as
Oxford Road, and straight as Bond-street,
very wide too, the houses all of stone, and at
least eight stories high. Over the shops live
people of fashion I am told, but the persons
of particularly high quality have their palaces
in other parts of the town; which town at
last is not a large one, but full as an egg:
and Mr. Clarke, the antiquarian, who resides
here always, informed me that the late distresses
in Calabria had driven many families to
Naples this year, beside single wanderers innumerable;
which wonderfully increased the
daily throng one sees passing and repassing.
To hear the Lazaroni shout and bawl about
the streets night and day, one would really
fancy one’s self in a semi-barbarous nation;
and a Milanese officer, who has lived long
among them, protested that the manners of
the great corresponded in every respect with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the idea given of them by the little. His account
of female conduct, and that even in the
very high ranks, was such as reminded me of
Queen Oberea’s sincerity, when Sir Joseph
Banks joked her about Otoroo. It is however
observable, and surely very praiseworthy,
that if the Italians are not ashamed of
their crimes, neither are they ashamed of their
contrition. I saw this very morning an odd
scene at church, which, though new to <em>me</em>,
appeared, perhaps from its frequent repetition,
to strike no one but myself.</p>

<p>A lady with a long white dress, and veiled,
came in her carriage, which waited for her
at the door, with her own arms upon it, and
three servants better dressed than is common
here, followed and put a lighted taper in her
hand. <i lang="fr">En cet état</i>, as the French say, she
moved slowly up the church, looking like
Jane Shore in the last act, but not so feeble;
and being arrived at the steps of the high
altar, threw herself quite upon her face before
it, remaining prostrate there at least five minutes,
in the face of the whole congregation,
who, equally to my amazement, neither
stared nor sneered, neither laughed nor lamented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
but minded their own private devotions&mdash;no
mass was saying&mdash;till the lady
rose, kissed the steps, and bathed them with
her tears, mingled with sobs of no affected
or hypocritical penitence I am sure. Retiring
afterwards to her own seat, where she waited
with others the commencement of the sacred
office, having extinguished her candle, and apparently
lighted her heart; I felt mine quite
penetrated by her behaviour, and fancied her
like our first parent described by Milton in
the same manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">To confess</div>
<div class="verse">Humbly her faults, and pardon beg; with tears</div>
<div class="verse">Watering the ground, and with her sighs the air</div>
<div class="verse">Frequenting, sent from heart contrite, in sign</div>
<div class="verse">Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let not this story, however, mislead any
one to think that more general decorum or
true devotion can be found in churches of the
Romish persuasion than in ours&mdash;quite the reverse.
This burst of penitential piety was
in itself an indecorous thing; but it is the
nature and genius of the people not to mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
small matters. Dogs are suffered to run
about and dirty the churches all the time
divine service is performing; while the crying
of babies, and the most indecent methods
taken by the women to pacify them, give one
still juster offence. There is no treading for
spittle and nastiness of one sort or another, in
all the churches of Italy, whose inhabitants
allow the filthiness of Naples, but endeavour
to justify the disorders of other cities; though
I do believe nothing ever equalled the Chiesa
de Cavalieri at Pisa, in any Christian land.
Santa Giustina at Padua, the Redentore at
Venice, St. Peter’s at Rome, and some of the
least frequented churches at Milan, are exceptions;
they are kept very clean, and do not,
by the scandalous neglect of those appointed
to keep them, disgrace the beauty of their
buildings.</p>

<p>Here has, however, been a dreadful accident
which puts such slight considerations out
of one’s head. A Friar has killed a woman
in the church just by the Crocelle inn, for
having refused him favours he suspected she
had granted to another. No step is taken
though towards punishing the murderer, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he is <i lang="it">religioso, è di più cavaliere</i>. What
a miracle that more such outrages are not
daily committed in a country where profession
of sanctity, and real high birth, are protections
from law and justice! Surely nothing but
perfect sobriety and great goodness of disposition
can be alleged as a reason why worse
is not done every day. I said so to a gentleman
just now, who assured me the criminal
would not escape very severe castigation; and
that perhaps the convent would inflict such
severities upon that gentleman as would amply
supply the want of activity in the exertion
of civil power.</p>

<p>It is a stupid thing not to mention the
common dress of the ordinary women here,
which ladies likewise adopt, if they venture
out on foot, desiring not to be known. Two
black silk petticoats then serve entirely to conceal
their whole figure; as when both are
tied round their waist, one is suddenly turned
up, and as they pull it quick over their heads,
a loose trimming of narrow black gauze drops
over the face, while a hook and eye fastens
all close under the chin, and gives them an
air not unlike our country wenches, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
throw the gown tail over their heads, to protect
them from a summer’s shower. The holiday
dresses mean time of the peasants round
Naples, are very rich and cumbersome. One
often sees a great coarse raw-boned fellow on
a Sunday, panting for heat under a thick blue
velvet coat comically enough; the females
in a scarlet cloth petticoat, with a broad gold
lace at the bottom, a jacket open before, but
charged with heavy ornaments, and the head
not unbecomingly dressed with an embroidered
handkerchief from Turkey, exactly as one
sees them represented here in prints, which
they sell dear enough, God knows; and ask,
as I am informed by the purchasers, not twice
or thrice, but four or five times more than
at last they take, as indeed for every thing
one buys here: One portrait is better, however,
than a thousand words, when single
figures are to be delineated; but of the Grotta
del Cane, description gives a completer idea
than drawing. Both are perhaps nearly unnecessary
indeed, when speaking of a place so
often and so accurately described. What
surprised me most among the ceremonies of
this extraordinary place was, that the pent up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
vapour shut in an excavation of the rock,
should, upon opening the door, gradually
move forwards a few yards, but not rise up
above a foot from the surface, nor, by what
I could observe, ever dissipate in air; I think
we left it hovering over the favourite spot,
when the poor cur’s nose had been forcibly
held in it for a minute or two, but he took
care after his recovery to keep a very judicious
distance. Sporting with animal life is
always highly offensive; and the fellow’s account
that his dog was used to the operation,
and had already gone through it eight times,
that it did him no harm, &amp;c. I considered as
words used merely to quiet our impatience of
the experiment, which is infinitely more amusing
when tried upon a lighted flambeau, extinguishing
it most completely in a moment.
What connection there is between flame and
vitality, those who know more of the matter
than I do, must expound. Certain it is, that
many sorts of vapour are equally fatal to both;
and where fermentation is either going forward,
or has lately been, people accustomed
to such matters always try with a candle whether
the cask is approachable by man or not;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and I once saw a terrifying accident arise in a
great brewhouse, from the headstrong stupidity
of a workman who would go down into
a vat, the contents of which had lately been
drawn off, without sending his proper præcursor
the candle, to enquire if all was safe.
The consequence was half expected by his
companions, who hearing him drop off the
steps, and fall flat to the bottom, began instantly
hooking him up again, but there were
no signs of life; some ran for their master,
others for a surgeon, but we were nearest at
hand, and recollecting what one had read of
the recovery of dogs at Naples, by tossing
them suddenly into the lake Agnano, we
made the men carry their patient to the cooler,
and plunging him over head and ears, restored
his life, exactly in the manner of the
Grotta del Cane experiment, which succeeded
so completely in this fellow’s case, I remember,
that waking after the temporary suspension,
we had much ado to impress so insensible a
mortal with a due sense of the danger his
rashness had incurred.</p>

<p>But it is time to tell of Herculaneum, Pompeia,
and Portici; of a theatre, the scene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
gaiety and pleasure, overwhelmed by torrents
of liquid fire! the inhabitants of a whole town
surprised by immediate and unavoidable destruction!
Where that very town indeed was
built with the lava produced by former eruptions,
one would think it scarce possible that such
calamities could be totally unexpected;&mdash;but
no matter, life must go on, though we all know
death is coming;&mdash;so the bread was baking in
their ovens, the meat was smoking on their
dishes, some of their wine already decanted for
use, the rest in large jars (<i lang="la">amphora</i>), now
petrified with their contents inside, and fixed
to the walls of the cellars in which they stand.&mdash;How
dreadful are the thoughts which such
a sight suggests! how <em>very</em> horrible the certainty,
that such a scene may be all acted over
again to-morrow; and that we, who to-day
are spectators, may become spectacles to travellers
of a succeeding century, who mistaking
our bones for those of the Neapolitans, may
carry some of them to their native country
back again perhaps; as it came into my head
that a French gentleman was doing, when I
saw him put a human bone into his pocket
this morning, and told him I hoped he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
got the jaw of a Gaulish officer, instead of a
Roman soldier, for future reflections to energize
upon. Of all single objects offered here
to one’s contemplation, none are more striking
than a woman’s foot, the <em>print</em> of her foot I
mean, taken apparently in the very act of
running from the river of melted minerals that
surrounded her, and which now serves as an
intaglio to commemorate the misery it caused.
Another melancholy proof of what needs no
confirmation, is the impression of a sick female,
known to be so from the <em>stole</em> she wore,
a drapery peculiar to the sex; her bed, converted
into a substance like plaster of Paris,
still retains the form and covering of her who
perished quietly upon it, without ever making
even an effort to escape.</p>

<p>That one of these towns is crushed, or
rather buried, under loads of heavy lava, and is
therefore difficult to disentangle, all have
heard; that Pompeia is only lightly covered
with pumice-stones and ashes, is new to nobody;
it is in the power, as a Venetian gentleman
said angrily, of an English hen and
chickens to scratch it open in a week, though
these lazy Neapolitans will leave it not half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
dislodged, before a new eruption swallows all
again.</p>

<p>Our visit to Portici was more than equally
provoking in the same way; to see deposited
there all the antiques which are so
curious in themselves, so <em>very</em> valuable when
considered as specimens of ancient art, and of
the mode of living practised in ancient Rome,
kept at a place where I do sincerely believe
they will be again overwhelmed and confounded
among the king of Naples’s furniture,
to the great torture of future antiquarians, and
to the disgrace of present insensibility.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la">triclinia</i> and <i lang="la">stibadia</i> used at supper by
the old Romans prove the verses which our
critics have been working at so long, to have
been at least well explained by them, and do
infinite honour to those who, without the advantage
of seeing how the utensils were constructed,
knew perfectly well their way of carrying
on life, from their acquaintance with a
language long since <em>dead</em>, and I am sure <em>buried</em>
under a heap of rubbish heavier and more
difficult to remove than all the lava heaped on
Herculaneum; but it is a source of perpetual
wonder, and let me add perpetual pleasure too,
to know that Cicero, and Virgil, and Horace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
if alive, would find their writings as well understood,
ay and as perfectly tasted, by the
scholars of Paris and London, as they had ever
been by their own old literary acquaintance.</p>

<p>The sight of the <i lang="la">curule</i> chair was charming,
and one thought of old Papyrius,
his long white beard, and ivory stick with
which he reproved the insolence of a Gaulish
soldier, who, when Brennus entered the city,
seeing all those venerable senators sitting in a
row, took them for inanimate figures, and
stroked Papyrius’s beard, to feel whether he
was alive or no. The <i lang="la">curule</i> chair was so
called from <i lang="la">currus</i> a chariot, and this we examined
had holes bored in it, where it had
been fixed to the car: I do think there is just
such a one in the British Musæum, but that
did not much engage my attention, so great is
the influence of locality upon the mind. The
way in which they decypher the old MSS.
here likewise is pretty and curious, and requires
infinite patience, which as far as they
have gone has not been well repaid; the
operation <i lang="la">laboriosius est quam Sibyllæ folia colligere</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>,
to use the words of Politian, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
right name I learned at Florence to be <i lang="it">Messer
Angelo di Monte Pulciano</i>.</p>

<p>May not, however, a more important consequence
than any yet mentioned be found
deducible from what we have seen this day?
for if <em>Jesus Christ</em> condescended to use the
Roman, or commonly adopted custom of supping
on a <i lang="la">triclinium</i> (as it is plain he did by
the recumbent posture of St. John), when
eating the Passover for the last time with his
disciples at Jerusalem; that sect of Christians
called Romanists ought sure to be the <em>last</em>,
not <em>first</em>, to exclude from salvation all such of
their brethren as do not receive the Lord’s
Supper precisely in <em>their way</em>; when nothing
can be clearer, from our blessed Saviour’s example,
than that he thought old forms, if
laudable, not necessary or essential to the well-performing
a devotional rite; seeing that to
eat the Passover according to original institution,
those who communicated were bound to
take it <em>standing</em>, and with a staff in their hands
beside as expressive of more haste.</p>

<p>The Christmas season here at Naples is very
pleasingly observed; the Italians are peculiarly
ingenious in adorning their shops I think, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
setting out their wares; every grocer, fruiterer,
&amp;c. now mingles orange, and lemon,
and myrtle leaves, among the goods exposed
at his door, as we do greens in the churches
of England, but with infinitely more taste; and
this device produces a very fine effect upon the
whole, as one drives along <i lang="it">la Strada del Toledo</i>,
which all morning looks showy from these
decorations, and all evening splendid from the
profusion of torches, flambeaux, &amp;c. that
shine with less regularity indeed, but with
more lustre and greater appearance of expensive
gaiety, than our neat, clean, steady London
lamps. Some odd, pretty, moveable coffee-houses
too, or lemonade-shops, set on wheels,
and adorned, according to the possessor’s taste,
with gilding, painting, &amp;c. and covered with
ices, orgeats, and other refreshments, as in
emulation each of the other, and in a strange
variety of shapes and forms too, exquisitely
well imagined for the most part,&mdash;help forward
the finery of Naples exceedingly: I
have counted thirty of these <i lang="it">galante</i> shops on
each side the street, which, with their necessary
illuminations, make a brilliant figure by candle-light,
till twelve o’clock, when all the show is
over, and every body put out their lights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
quietly lie down to rest. Till that hour, however,
few things can exceed the tumultuous
merriment of Naples, while <i lang="it">volantes</i>, or running
footmen, dressed like tumblers before a
show, precede all carriages of distinction, and
endeavour to keep the people from being run
over; yet whilst they are listening to Policinello’s
jokes, or to some such street orator as
Dr. Moore describes with equal truth and humour,
they often get crushed and killed; yet,
as Pope says,</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i lang="it">Lazaroni</i> who has his child run over by
the coach of a man of quality, has a regular
claim upon him for no less than twelve <i lang="it">carlines</i>
(about five shillings English); if it is his wife
that meets with the accident, he gets two
<i lang="it">ducats</i>, live or die; and for the master of the
family (house he has none) three is the regular
compensation; and no words pass here about
<em>trifles</em>. Truth is, human life is lower rated in
all parts of Italy than with us; they think
nothing of an individual, but see him perish
(excepting by the hand of justice) as a cat
or dog. A young man fell from our carriage
at Milan one evening; he was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
servant of ours, but a friend which, after we were
gone home, the coachman had picked up to go
with him to the fireworks which were exhibited
that night near the <i lang="it">Corso</i>: there was a
crowd and an <i lang="it">embarras</i>, and the fellow tumbled
off and died upon the spot, and nobody
even spoke, or I believe <em>thought</em> about the
matter, except one woman, who supposed that
he had neglected to cross himself when he got
up behind.</p>

<p>The works of art here at Naples are neither
very numerous nor very excellent: I have
seen the vaunted present of porcelain intended
for the king of England, in return for some
cannon presented by him to this court; and
think it more entertaining in its design than
admirable as a manufacture. Every dish and
plate, however, being the portrait as one may
say of some famous Etruscan vase, or other
antique, dug out of the ruins of these newly-discovered
cities, with an account of its supposed
story engraved neatly round the figure,
makes it interesting and elegant, and worthy
enough of one prince to accept, and another
to bestow.</p>

<p>There is a work of art, however, peculiar
to this city, and attempted in no other; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which surprising sums of money are lavished
by many of the inhabitants, who connect or
associate to this amusement ideas of piety and
devotion: the thing when finished is called a
<i lang="it">presepio</i>, and is composed in honour of this
sacred season, after which all is taken to
pieces, and arranged after a different manner
next year. In many houses a room, in some
a whole suite of apartments, in others the terrace
upon the house-top, is dedicated to this
very uncommon show; consisting of a miniature
representation in sycamore wood, properly
coloured, of the house at Bethlehem,
with the blessed Virgin, St. Joseph, and our
Saviour in the manger, with attendant angels,
&amp;c. as in pictures of the nativity; the
figures are about six inches high, and dressed
with the most exact propriety. This however,
though the principal thing intended to
attract spectators’ notice, is kept back, so that
sometimes I scarcely saw it at all; while a general
and excellent landscape, with figures of
men at work, women dressing dinner, a
long road in real gravel, with rocks, hills,
rivers, cattle, camels, every thing that can be
imagined, fill the other rooms, so happily disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
too for the most part, the light introduced
so artfully, the perspective kept so surprisingly!&mdash;one
wonders and cries out, it is
certainly but a baby-house at best; yet managed
by people whose heads naturally turned
towards architecture and design, give them
power thus to defy a traveller not to feel delighted
with the general effect; while if every
single figure is not capitally executed, and
nicely expressed beside, the proprietor is truly
miserable, and will cut a new cow, or vary the
horse’s attitude, against next Christmas <i lang="fr">coûte
qui coûte</i>: and perhaps I should not have said
so much about the matter, if there had not
been shewn me within this last week, <i lang="it">presepios</i>
which have cost their possessors fifteen hundred
or two thousand English pounds; and, rather
than relinquish or sell them, many families have
gone to ruin: I have wrote the sums down in
letters, not figures, for fear of the possibility of
a mistake. One of these playthings had the
journey of the three kings represented in it,
and the presents were all of real gold and
silver finely worked; nothing could be better
or more livelily finished.&mdash;“But, Sir,” said I,
“why do you dress up one of the Wise Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with a turban and <em>crescent</em>, six hundred years
before the birth of Mahomet, who first put
that mark in the forehead of his followers?
The eastern Magi were not <em>Turks</em>; this is a
breach of <em>costume</em>.” My gentleman paused,
and thanked me; said he would enquire if
there was nothing heretical in the objection;
and if all was right, it should be changed
next year without fail.</p>

<p>A young lady here of English parents,
just ten years old, asked me, very pertinently,
“Why this pretty sight was called a <em>Presepio</em>?”
but said she suddenly, answering
herself, “I suppose it is because it is <em>preceptive</em>:”
such a mistake was more valuable
than knowledge, and gave me great esteem
of her understanding; the little girl’s name
was Zaffory.</p>

<p>The King’s <i lang="fr">menagerie</i> is neither rich in
animals, nor particularly well kept: I wonder
a man of his character and disposition
should not delight in possessing a very fine
one. The bears however were as tame as
lapdogs; there was a wolf too, larger than
ever I saw a wolf, and an elephant that played
a hundred tricks at the command of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
keeper, little less a beast than he; but as
Pope says, after Horace,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Let us then tell about the two assemblies,
<i lang="it">o sia conversazioni</i>, where one goes in search
of amusement as to the rooms of Bath or
Tunbridge exactly; only that one of these
places is devoted to the <i lang="it">nobiltà</i>, the other is
called <i lang="it">de’ buoni amici</i>; and such is the state of
subordination in this country, that though
the great people may come among the little
ones, and be sure of the grossest adulation,
a merchant’s wife, shining in diamonds,
being obliged to stand up reverentially before
the chair of a countess, who does her the
honour to speak to her; the poor <i lang="it">amici</i> are
totally excluded from the subscription of the
nobles, nor dare even to return the salutation
of a superior, should a good-natured person
of that rank be tempted, from frequently seeing
them at the rooms, to give them a kind
nod in the street or elsewhere. All this seems
comical enough to us, and I had much ado
to look grave, while a beautiful and well-educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
wife of a rich banker here, confessed
herself not fit company for an ignorant mean-looking
woman of quality. But though such
unintelligible doctrines make one for a moment
ashamed both of one’s sex and species,
that lady’s knowledge of various languages,
her numerous accomplishments in a thousand
methods of passing time away with innocent
elegance, and a sort of studied address never
observed in Italy before, gave me infinite
delight in her society, and daily increased
my suspicion that she was a foreigner, till
nearer intimacy discovered her a German
Lutheran, with a singular head of thick
blonde hair, so unlike those I see around me.
We grew daily better acquainted, and she
shewed me&mdash;but not indignantly at all&mdash;some
ladies from the higher assembly sitting among
<em>these</em>, very low dressed indeed, a knotting-bag
and counters in their lap, to shew their
contempt of the company; while such as
spoke to them stood before their seat, like
children before a governess in England, as
long as the conversation lasted.</p>

<p>I inquired if the men confined their addresses
wholly to their own rank? She said,
beauty often broke the barrier, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a pretty woman of the second rank got a
<i lang="it">cavalier servente</i> of the first, much happiness
and much distinction was the consequence:
but alas! he will not even <em>try</em> to push her up
among the people of fashion, and when he
meets any is sure to look ashamed of his
mistress; so that her felicity can consist only
in triumphing over equals, for to rival a
superior is here an impossibility.</p>

<p>Our Duke and Dutchess of Cumberland
have made all Naples adore them though, by
going richly dressed, and behaving with infinite
courtesy and good-humour, at an assembly
or ball given in the <em>lower rooms</em>, as
the English comically call them. A young
Palermitan prince applauded them for it exceedingly;
so I took the liberty to express
my wonder. “Oh,” replied he, “we are not
ignorant how much English manners differ
from our own: I have already, though but
just eighteen years old, as sovereign of my
own state, under the King of both Sicilies,
condemned a man to death <em>because he was a
rascal</em>, but the law and the people govern
in England I know.” My desire of hearing
about Sicily, which we could not contrive to
visit, made me happy to cultivate Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Ventimiglia’s acquaintance; he was very
studious, very learned of his age, and uncommonly
clever: told me of the antiquities
his island had to boast, with great intelligence,
and a surprising knowledge of ancient
history.</p>

<p>We wished to have made a party to go in
the same company to Pæstum, but my cowardice
kept me at home, so bad was the account
of the roads and accommodation; though
Abate Bianconi of Milan, for whom I have so
much esteem, bid me remember to look at the
buildings there attentively; adding, that they
were better worth our observation than all
the boasted antiquities at Rome; “as they
had seen (said he) the original foundation
of her empire, and outlived its decay: that
they had seen her second birth too, and
power under some of her pontiffs over all
Europe about six or seven centuries ago; and
that they would now probably remain till all
<em>that</em> was likewise abolished, with only slight
traces left behind to shew that <i lang="la">fuimus</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>How mortifying it is to go home and never
see this Pæstum! Prince Ventimiglia went
there with Mr. Cox; he professes his intention
soon to visit England, concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
manners and customs of which he is very inquisitive,
and not ill-versed in the language;
but books drop oddly into people’s hands:
This gentleman commended Ambrose Philips’s
Pastorals, and I remember the Florentines
seemed strangely impressed with the merit
of the other Philips as a poet. Bonducci has
translated his Cyder, and calls him <em>emulous
of Milton</em>, in good time! but it is difficult
to distinguish jest from earnest in a foreign
language.</p>

<p>I will not, if I can help it, lose sight of
our Sicilian however, till I have made him
tell me something about Dionysius’s Ear,
about the eruptions of Ætna, and the <i lang="it">Castagno
a cento cavalli</i>, which, he protests, is
not magnified by Brydone.</p>

<p>It is wonderfully mortifying to think how
little information after all can be obtained of
any thing new or any thing strange, though
so far from one’s own country. What I
picked up most curious and diverting from
our conversation, was his expression of surprise,
when at our house one day he read a
letter from his mother, telling him that such
a lady, naming her, remained still unmarried,
and even unbetrothed, though now past ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
years old. “She will,” said I, “perhaps
break through old customs, and chuse for
herself, as she is an orphan, and has no one
whom she need consult.”&mdash;“Impossible,
Madam!” was the reply.&mdash;“But tell me,
Prince, for information’s sake, if such a lady,
this girl for example, should venture to
assert the rights of humanity, and make a
choice somewhat unusual, <em>what would come
of it?</em>”&mdash;“Why nothing in the world would
come of it,” answered he; “the lass would be
immediately at liberty again, for no man so
circumstanced could be permitted to leave the
country <em>alive</em> you know, nor would her folly
benefit his family at all, as her estate would
be immediately adjudged to the next heir.
No person of inferior rank in our country
would therefore, unless absolutely mad, set
his life to hazard for the sake of a frolic, the
event of which is so well known beforehand;&mdash;less
still, because, if <em>love</em> be in the
case, all <em>personal attachment</em> may be fully
gratified, only let her but be once legally
married to a man every way her equal.”
Could one help recollecting Fielding’s song in
the Virgin unmasked? who says,</p>

<p>I will mention another talk I had with a
Sicilian lady. We met at the house of the
Swedish minister, Monsieur André, uncle to
the lamented officer who perished in our sovereign’s
service in America; and while the
rest of the company were entertaining themselves
with cards and music, I began laughing
in myself at hearing the gentleman and lady
who sat next <em>me</em>, called by others <em>Don Raphael</em>
and <em>Donna Camilla</em>, because those two
names bring Gil Blas into one’s head. Their
agreeable and interesting conversation however
soon gave my mind a more serious turn
when discoursing on the liberal premiums now
offered by the King of Naples to those who
are willing to rebuild and repeople Messina.
Donna Camilla politely introduced me to a
very sick but pleasing-looking lady, who she
said was going to return thither: at which
<em>she</em>, starting, cried, “Oh God forbid, my
dear friend!” in an accent that made me think
she had already suffered something from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
concussions that overwhelmed that city in the
year 1783. Her inviting manner, her soft
and interesting eyes, whose languid glances
seemed to shew beauty sunk in sorrow, and
spirit oppressed by calamity, engaged my utmost
attention, while Don Raphael pressed her
to indulge the foreigner’s curiosity with some
particulars of the distresses she had shared.
Her own feelings were all she could relate she
said&mdash;and those confusedly. “You see that
girl there,” pointing to a child about seven or
eight years old, who stood listening to the harpsichord:
“she escaped! I cannot, for my soul,
guess how, for we were not together at the
time.”&mdash;“Where were <em>you</em>, madam, at the moment
of the fatal accident?”&mdash;“Who? <em>me</em>?” and
her eyes lighted up with recollected terror: “I
was in the nursery with my maid, employed in
taking stains out of some Brussels lace upon
a brazier; two babies, neither of them four
years old, playing in the room. The eldest
boy, dear lad! had just left us, and was in
his father’s country-house. The day grew
<em>so</em> dark all on a sudden, and the brazier&mdash;Oh,
Lord Jesus! I felt the brazier slide from me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and saw it run down the long room on its
three legs. The maid screamed, and I shut
my eyes and knelt at a chair. We thought
all over; but my husband came, and snatching
me up, cried, <em>run, run</em>.&mdash;I know not
how nor where, but all amongst falling
houses it was, and people shrieked so, and
there was <em>such</em> a noise! My poor son! he
was fifteen years old; he tried to hold me
fast in the crowd. I remember kissing <em>him</em>:
Dear lad, dear lad! I said. I could speak <em>just
then</em>: but the throng at the gate! Oh that
gate! Thousands at once! ay, thousands!
thousands at once: and my poor old confessor
too! I knew him: I threw my arms
about his aged neck. <i lang="it">Padre mio!</i> said I&mdash;<i lang="it">Padre
mio!</i> Down he dropt, a great stone
struck his shoulder; I saw it coming, and my
boy pulled me: he saved my life, dear, dear
lad! But the crash of the gate, the screams
of the people, the heat&mdash;Oh such a heat! I
felt no more on’t though; I saw no more on’t;
I waked in bed, this girl by me, and her father
giving me cordials. We were on shipboard,
they told me, coming to Naples to my brother’s
house here; and do you think I’ll
ever go back <em>there</em> again? No, no; that’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
curst place; I lost my son in it. <em>Never, never</em>
will I see it more! All my friends try to persuade
me, but the sight of it would do my
business. If my poor boy were alive indeed!
but <em>he!</em> ah, poor dear lad! he loved his mother;
he held <em>me</em> fast&mdash;No, no, I’ll never see
that place again: God has cursed it <em>now</em>; I
am sure he has.”</p>

<p>A narrative so melancholy, so tender, and
so true, could not fail of its effect. I ran for
refuge to the harpsichord, where a lady was
singing divinely. I could not listen though:
<em>her</em> grateful sweetness who told the dismal
story, followed me thither: she had seen my
ill-suppressed tears, and followed to embrace
me. The tale she had told saddened my heart,
and the news we heard returning to the Crocelle
did not contribute to lighten its weight,
while an amiable young Englishman, who
had long lain ill there, was now breathing
his last, far from his friends, his country, or
their customs; all easily dispensed with, perhaps
derided, during the bustle of a journey,
and in the madness of superfluous health; but
sure to be sighed after, when life’s last twilight
shuts in precipitately closer and closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
round a man, and leaves him only the nearer
objects to repose and dwell on.</p>

<p>Such was Captain &mdash;&mdash;’s situation! he had
none but a foreign servant with him. We
thought it might sooth him to hear “<cite>Can I
do any thing for you, Sir?</cite>” in an English
voice: so I sent my maid: he had no commands
he said; he could not eat the jelly she
had made him; he wished some clergyman
could be found that he might speak to: such
a one was vainly enquired for, till it was discovered
that ill-health had driven Mr. Mentze
to Naples, who kindly administered the last
consolation a Christian can receive; and heard
the next day, when confined himself to bed,
of his countryman’s being properly thrust
by the banker into the <i lang="it">Buco Protestante</i>; so
they contemptuously call a dirty garden one
drives by in this town, where not less than a
hundred people, small and great, from our
island, annually resort, leaving fifty or sixty
thousand pounds behind them at a moderate
computation; though if their bodies are obliged
to take <em>perpetual</em> apartments here, no
better place has been hitherto provided for
them than this kitchen ground; on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
grow cabbages, cauliflowers, &amp;c. sold to their
country folks for double price I trow, the remaining
part of the season.</p>

<p>Well! well! if the Neapolitans do bury
Christians like dogs, they make some singular
compensations we will confess, by nursing dogs
like Christians. A very veracious man informed
me yester morning, that his poor
wife was half broken-hearted at hearing such
a Countess’s dog was run over; “for,” said
he, “having suckled the pretty creature herself,
she loved it like one of her children.”
I bid him repeat the circumstance, that no
mistake might be made: he did so; but seeing
me look shocked, or ashamed, or something
he did not like,&mdash;“Why, madam,” said
the fellow, “it is a common thing enough
for ordinary men’s wives to suckle the lapdogs
of ladies of quality:” adding, that they
were paid for their milk, and he saw no harm
in gratifying one’s <em>superiors</em>. As I was disposed
to see nothing <em>but</em> harm in disputing
with such a competitor, our conference finished
soon; but the fact is certain.</p>

<p>Indeed few things can be foolisher than to
debate the propriety of customs one is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bound to observe or comply with. If you
dislike them, the remedy is easy; turn yours
and your horses heads the other way.</p>

<p class="right">20th January 1786.</p>

<p>Here are the most excellent, the most incomparable
fish I ever eat; red mullets, large
as our maycril, and of singularly high flavour;
besides the calamaro, or ink-fish, a
dainty worthy of imperial luxury; almond
and even apple trees in blossom, to delight
those who can be paid for coarse manners and
confined notions by the beauties of a brilliant
climate. Here are all the hedges in blow as
you drive towards Pozzuoli, and a snow of
white May-flowers clustering round Virgil’s
tomb. So strong was the sun’s heat this morning,
even before eleven o’clock, that I carried
an umbrella to defend me from his rays, as we
sauntered about the walks, which are spacious
and elegant, laid out much in the style of
St. James’s Park, but with the sea on one side
of you, the broad street, called Chiaja, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
other. What trees are planted there however,
either do not grow up so as to afford shade,
or else they cut them, and trim them about
to make them in pretty shapes forsooth, as we
did in England half a century ago.</p>

<p>Be this as it will, the vaunted view from the
castle of St. Elmo, though much more deeply
<em>interesting</em>, is in consequence of this defect less
<em>naturally</em> pleasing than the prospect from Lomellino’s
villa near Genoa, or Lord Clifford’s
park, called King’s Weston, in Somersetshire;
those two places being, in point of mere situation,
possessed of beauties hitherto unrivalled
by any thing I have seen. Nor does the steady
regularity of this Mediterranean sea make me
inclined to prefer it to our more capricious or
rather active channel. Sea views have at best
too little variety, and when the flux and reflux
of the tide are taken away from one, there remains
only rough and smooth: whereas the
hope which its ebb and flow keep constantly
renovating, serves to animate, and a little
change the course of one’s ideas, just as its
swelling and sinking is of use, to purify in
some degree, and keep the whole from stagnation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>I made inquiry after the old story of Nicola
Pesce, told by Kircher, and sweetly
brought back to all our memories by Goldsmith,
who, as Dr. Johnson said of him,
touched nothing that he did not likewise
adorn; but I could gain no addition to what
we have already heard. That there was such
a man is certain, who, though become nearly
amphibious by living constantly in the water,
only coming sometimes on shore for sleep and
refreshment, suffered avarice to be his ruin,
leaping voluntarily into the Gulph of Charybdis
to fetch out a gold cup thrown in thither to
tempt him&mdash;what could a gold cup have done
one would wonder for Nicola Pesce?&mdash;yet
knowing the dangers of the place, he braved
them all it seems for this bright reward; and
was supposed to be devoured by one of the
polypus fish, who, sticking close to the rocks,
extend their arms for prey. When I expressed
my indignation that he should so perish;
“He forgot perhaps,” said one present,
“to recommend himself to Santo Gennaro.”</p>

<p>The castle on this hill, called the Castel St.
Elmo, would be much my comfort did I fix
at Naples; for here are eight thousand soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
constantly kept, to secure the city from sudden
insurrection; his majesty most wisely
trusting their command only to Spanish or
German officers, or some few gentlemen from
the northern states of Italy, that no personal
tenderness for any in the town below may intervene,
if occasion for sudden severity should
arise. We went to-day and saw their garrison,
comfortably and even elegantly kept; and
I was wicked enough to rejoice that the soldiers
were never, but with the very utmost
difficulty, permitted to go among the towns-men
for a moment.</p>

<p>To-morrow we mount the Volcano, whose
present peaceful disposition has tempted us to
inspect it more nearly. Though it appears
little less than presumption thus to profane
with eyes of examination the favourite alembic
of nature, while the great work of projection
is carrying on; guarded as all its secret
caverns are too with every contradiction; snow
and flame! solid bodies heated into liquefaction,
and rolling gently down one of its sides;
while fluids congeal and harden into ice on
the other; nothing can exceed the curiosity
of its appearance, now the lava is less rapid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and stiffens as it flows; stiffens too in ridges
very surprisingly, and gains an odd aspect, not
unlike the pasteboard waves representing sea
at a theatre, but black, because this year’s
eruption has been mingled with coal. The
connoisseurs here know the different degrees,
dates, and shades of lava to a perfection that amazes
one; and Sir William Hamilton’s courage,
learning, and perfect skill in these matters, is
more people’s theme here than the Volcano
itself. Bartolomeo, the Cyclop of Vesuvius as
he is called, studies its effects and operations
too with much attention and philosophical exactness,
relating the adventures he has had
with our minister on the mountain to every
Englishman that goes up, with great success.
The way one climbs is by tying a broad sash
with long ends round this Bartolomeo, letting
him walk before one, and holding it fast. As
far as the Hermitage there is no great difficulty,
and to that place some chuse to ride an
ass, but I thought walking safer; and there
you are sure of welcome and refreshment
from the poor good old man, who sets up a
little cross wherever the fire has stopt near his
cell; shews you the place with a sort of polite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
solemnity that impresses, spreads his scanty
provisions before you kindly, and tells the past
and present state of the eruption accurately,
inviting you to partake of</p>

<p>This Hermit is a Frenchman. <i lang="fr">J’ai dansé
dans mon lit tans de fois</i><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, said he: the expression
was not sublime when speaking of an
earthquake, to be sure; I looked among his
books, however, and found Bruyere. “Would
not the Duc de Rochefoucault have done better?”
said I. “Did I never see you before, Madam?”
said he; “yes, sure I have, and dressed
you too, when I was a hair-dresser in London,
and lived with Mons. Martinant, and I dressed
pretty Miss Wynne too in the same street.
<i lang="fr">Vit’elle encore? Vit’elle encore?</i><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Ah I am old
now,” continued he; “I remember when black
pins first came up.” This was charming, and in
such an unexpected way, I could hardly prevail
upon myself ever to leave the spot; but
Mrs. Greatheed having been quite to the crater’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
edge with her only son, a baby of four
years old; shame rather than inclination urged
me forward; I asked the little boy what
he had seen; I saw the chimney, replied he,
and it was on fire, but I liked the elephant
better.</p>

<p>That the situation of the crater changed in
this last eruption is of little consequence; it
will change and change again I suppose. The
wonder is, that nobody gets killed by venturing
so near, while red-hot stones are flying
about them so. The Bishop of Derry did
very near get his arm broke; and the Italians
are always recounting the exploits of these
rash Britons who look into the crater, and
carry their wives and children up to the top;
while we are, with equal justice, amazed at
the courageous Neapolitans, who build little
snug villages and dwell with as much confidence
at the foot of Vesuvius, as our people
do in Paddington or Hornsey. When I enquired
of an inhabitant of these houses how
she managed, and whether she was not frighted
when the Volcano raged, lest it should
carry away her pretty little habitation: “Let
it go,” said she, “we don’t mind now if it goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to-morrow, so as we can make it answer by
raising our vines, oranges, &amp;c. against it for
three years, our fortune is made before the
fourth arrives; and then if the red river comes
we can always run away, <i lang="it">scappar via</i>, ourselves,
and hang the property. We only desire
three years use of the mountain as a hot wall
or forcing-house, and then we are above the
world, thanks be to God and St. Januarius,”
who always comes in for a large share of their
veneration; and this morning having heard
that the Neapolitans still present each other
with a cake upon New-year’s day, I began to
hug my favourite hypothesis closer, recollecting
the old ceremony of the wheaten cake
seasoned with salt, and called <em>Janualis</em> in the
Heathen days. All this however must still
end in mere conjecture; for though the weather
here favours one’s idea of Janus, who
loosened the furrow and liquefied the frost, to
which the melting our martyr’s blood might,
without much straining of the matter, be
made to allude; yet it must be recollected
after all, that the miracle is not performed in
this month but that of May, and that St. Januarius
did certainly exist and give his life as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
testimony to the truth of our religion, in the
third century. Can one wonder, however,
if corruptions and mistakes should have crept
in since? And would it not have been equal
to a miracle had no tares sprung up in the
field of religion, when our Saviour himself informs
us that there is an enemy ever watching
his opportunity to plant them?</p>

<p>These dear people too at Rome and Naples
do live so in the very hulk of ship-wrecked or
rather foundered Paganism, have their habitation
so at the very bottom of the cask, can it fail
to retain the scent when the lees are scarce yet
dried up, clean or evaporated? That an odd
jumble of past and present days, past and present
ideas of dignity, events, and even manner
of portioning out their time, still confuse their
heads, may be observed in every conversation
with them; and when a few weeks ago we
revisited, in company of some newly-arrived
English friends, the old baths of Baiæ, Locrine
lake, &amp;c. Tobias, who rowed us over,
bid us observe the Appian way under the water,
where indeed it appears quite clearly, even
to the tracks of wheels on its old pavement
made of very large stones; and seeing me perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
particularly attentive, “Yes, Madam,” said
he, “I do assure you, that <em>Don</em> Horace and
<em>Don</em> Virgil, of whom we hear such a deal,
used to come from Rome to their country-seats
here in a day, over this very road, which is
now overflowed as you see it, by repeated
earthquakes, but which was then so good and
so unbroken, that if they rose early in the
morning they could easily gallop hither against
the <cite>Ave Maria</cite>.”</p>

<p>It was very observable in our second visit
paid to the Stuffe San Germano, that they had
increased prodigiously in heat since mount
Vesuvius had ceased throwing out fire, though
at least fourteen miles from it, and a vast portion
of the sea between them; it vexed me to
have no thermometer again, but by what one’s
immediate feelings could inform us, there
were many degrees of difference. I could not
now bear my hand on any part of them for a
moment. The same luckless dog was again
produced, and again restored to life, like the
lady in Dryden’s Fables, who is condemned
to be hunted, killed, recovered, and set on foot
again for the amusement of her tormentors;
a story borrowed from the Italian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Solfaterra burned my fingers as I plucked
an incrustation off, which allured me by the
beauty of its colours, and roared with more
violence than when I was there before. This
horrible volcano is by no means extinguished
yet, but seems pregnant with wonders, principally
combustible, and likely to break with
one at every step, all the earth round it being
hollow as a drum, and I should think of no
great thickness neither; so plainly does one
hear the sighings underneath, which some of
the country people imagine to be tortured
spirits howling with agony.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Lake Agnano, where
the dog is flung in, if the dewy grass do not
suffice to recover him, with its humidity and
freshness, as it often does; is but another
crater of another volcano, long ago self-destroyed
by scorpion-like suicide; and it is
like enough it may be so. There are not
wanting however those that think, or say at
least, how a subterraneous or subaqueous
city remains even now under that lake, but
lies too deep for inspection.</p>

<p><i lang="it">Sia come sia</i><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, as the Italians express themselves,
these environs are beyond all power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of comprehension, much more beyond all
effort of words to describe; and as Sannazarius
says of Venice, so I am sure it may be said
of this place, “That man built Rome, but God
created Naples:” for surely, surely he has honoured
no other spot with such an accumulation
of his wonders: nor can any thing more
completely bring the description of the devoted
cities mentioned in Genesis before one’s eyes,
than these concealed fires, which there I trust
burst up unexpectedly, and, attended by such
lightning as only hot countries can exhibit,
devoured all at once, nor spared the too incredulous
inquirer, who turned her head
back with contempt of expected judgments,
but entangling her feet in the pursuing
stream of lava, fixed her fast, a monument
of bituminous salt.</p>

<p>Though surrounded by such terrifying objects,
the Neapolitans are not, I think, disposed
to cowardly, though easily persuaded
to devotional superstitions; they are not
afraid of spectres or supernatural apparitions,
but sleep contentedly and soundly in small
rooms, made for the ancient dead, and now
actually in the occupation of old Roman
bodies, the catacombs belonging to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
are still very impressive to the fancy; and I
have known many an English gentleman,
who would not endure to have his courage
impeached by <em>living wight</em>, whose imagination
would notwithstanding have disturbed
his slumbers not a little, had he been obliged
to pass one night where these poor women
sleep securely, wishing only for that money
which travellers are not unwilling to bestow;
and perhaps a walk among these hollow caves
of death, these sad repositories of what was
once animated by valour and illuminated by
science, strike one much more than all the
urns and lachrymatories of Portici.</p>

<p>How judicious is Mr. Addison’s remark,
“That <i lang="la">Siste Viator!</i> which has a striking effect
among the Roman tombs placed by the
road side, loses all its power over the mind
when placed in the body of a church:” I
think he might have said the same, had he
lived to see funereal urns used as decorations
of hackney-coach pannels, and <i lang="la">Caput Bovis</i>
over the doors in New Tavistock-street.</p>

<p>It is worth recollecting however, that the
Dictator Sylla is supposed to be the first man
of consequence who ordered his body to be
burned at Rome, as till then, burial was apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the fashion: his death, occasioned
by the <i lang="la">morbus pedicularis</i>, made his interment
difficult, and what necessity suggested to
be done for him, grew up into a custom,
and the sycophants of power, ever hasty to
follow their superiors, now shewed their zeal
even in <i lang="la">post obit</i> imitation. But while I am
writing, more modern and less tyrannic
claimants for respect agreeably disturb one’s
meditations on the cruelty and oppression
used by these wicked possessors of immortal
though ill-gotten fame.</p>

<p>The Queen of Naples is delivered, and
we are all to make merry: the <i lang="it">Castello
d’Uovo</i>, just under our windows, is to be
illuminated: and from the Carthusian convent
on the hill, to my poor solitary old
acquaintance the hermit and hair-dresser,
who inhabits a cleft in mount Vesuvius, all
resolve to be happy, and to rejoice in the
felicity of a prince that loves them.&mdash;Shouting,
and candles, and torches, and
coloured lamps, and Polinchinello above all
the rest, did their best to drive forward the
general joy, and make known the birth of
the royal baby for many miles round the
capital; and there was a splendid opera the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
next night, in this finest of all fine theatres,
though that of Milan pleases me better; as I
prefer the elegant curtains which festoon it
over the boxes there, to our heavy gilt ornaments
here at Naples; and their boasted
looking-glasses, never cleaned, have no effect
as I perceive towards helping forward the
enchantment. A <i lang="it">festa di ballo</i>, or masquerade,
given here however, was exceedingly
gay, and the dresses surprisingly rich: <em>our</em>
party, a very large one, all Italians, retired
at one in the morning to quite the finest supper
of its size I ever saw. Fish of various
sorts, incomparable in their kinds, composed
eight dishes of the first course; we had thirty-eight
set on the table in that course, forty-nine
in the second, with wines and dessert truly
magnificent, for all which Mr. Piozzi protested
to me that we paid only three shillings
and sixpence a head English money; but for
the truth of that he must answer: we sate
down twenty-two persons to supper, and I
observed there were numbers of these parties
made in different taverns, or apartments
adjoining to the theatre, whither after refreshment
we returned, and danced till day-light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The theatre is a vast building, even
when not inhabited or set off by lights and
company: all of stone too, like that of
Milan; but particularly defended from fire by
St. Anthony, who has an altar and chapel
erected to his honour, and showily decorated
at the door; and on Sunday night, January the
twenty-second, there were fireworks exhibited
in honour of himself and his <em>pig</em>, which was
placed on the top, and illuminated with no
small ingenuity: the fire catching hold of
his tail first&mdash;<i lang="it">con rispetto</i>&mdash;as said our Cicerone.
But <i lang="it">il Rè Lear è le sue tre Figlie</i> are
advertised, and I am sick to-night and cannot
go.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh what a time have I chose out, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="verse">To wear a kerchief&mdash;would I were not sick!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">My loss however is somewhat compensated;
for though I could not see our own Shakespear’s
play acted at Naples, I went some days after to
one of the charming theatres this town is entertained
by every evening, and saw a play
which struck me exceedingly: the plot was
simply this&mdash;An Englishman appears, dressed
precisely as a Quaker, his hat on his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his hands in his pockets, and with a very
pensive air says he will take that pistol, producing
one, and shoot himself; “for,” says
he, “the politics go wrong at home now,
and I hate the ministerial party, so England
does not please me; I tried France, but the
people there laughed so about nothing, and
sung so much out of tune, I could not bear
France; so I went over to Holland; those
Dutch dogs are so covetous and hard-hearted,
they think of nothing but their money; I
could not endure a place where one heard no
sound in the whole country but frogs croaking
and ducats chinking. <i lang="it">Maladetti!</i> so I
went to Spain, where I narrowly escaped a
sun-stroke for the sake of seeing those idle
beggarly dons, that if they do condescend to
cobble a man’s shoe, think they must do it
with a sword by their side. I came here to
Naples therefore, but ne’er a woman will
afford one a chase, all are too easily caught
to divert <em>me</em>, who like something in prospect;
and though it is so fine a country, one can
get no fox-hunting, only running after a
wild pig. Yes, yes, I <em>must</em> shoot myself, the
world is so <em>very</em> dull I am tired on’t.”&mdash;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
then coolly prepares matters for the operation,
when a young woman bursts into his apartment,
bewails her fate a moment, and then
faints away. Our countryman lays by his
pistol, brings the lady to life, and having
heard part of her story, sets her in a place
of safety. More confusion follows; a gentleman
enters storming with rage at a treacherous
friend he hints at, and a false mistress;
the Englishman gravely advises him to
shoot himself: “No, no,” replies the warm
Italian, “I will shoot <em>them</em> though, if I can
catch them; but want of money hinders me
from prosecuting the search.” <em>That</em> however
is now instantly supplied by the generous
Briton, who enters into their affairs, detects
and punishes the rogue who had betrayed
them all, settles the marriage and reconciliation
of his new friends, adds himself something
to the good girl’s fortune, and concludes
the piece with saying that he has altered
his intentions, and will think no more of
shooting himself, while life may in all countries
be rendered pleasant to him who will
employ it in the service of his fellow-creatures;
and finishes with these words, that
<em>such are the sentiments of an Englishman</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Were this pretty story in the hands of one
of our elegant dramatic writers, how charming
an entertainment would it make us! Mr.
Andrews shall have it certainly, for though
very flattering in its intentions towards our
countrymen, and the <em>ground-plot</em>, as a <em>surveyor</em>
would call it, well imagined; the play
itself was scarcely written I believe, and very
little esteemed by the Italians; who made
excuses for its grossness, and said that their
theatre was at a very low ebb; and so I believe
it is. Yet their genius is restless, and
for ever fermenting; and although, like their
volcano, of which every individual has a
spark, it naturally throws out of its mouth
more rubbish than marble; like that too,
from some occasional eruptions we may gather
gems stuck fast among substances of an inferior
nature, which want only disentangling, and
a new polish, to make them valued, even
beyond those that reward the toil of an expecting
miner.</p>

<p>The word gems reminds one of <i lang="it">Capo di
Monte</i>, where the king’s <i lang="it">cameos</i> are taken care
of, and where the medallist may find perpetual
entertainment; for I do believe nothing can
exceed the riches of this collection; though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
requires good eyes, great experience, and long
study, to examine their merits with accurate
skill, and praise them with intelligent rapture:
of these three requisites I boast none, so cannot
enjoy this regale as much as many others;
but I have a mortal aversion to those who
encumber the general progress of science by
reciprocating contempt upon its various
branches: the politician however, who weighs
the interests of contending powers, or endeavours
at the happiness of regulating some particular
state; who studies to prevent the encroachments
of prerogative, or impede advances
to anarchy; hears with faint approbation,
at best, of the discoveries made in the
moon by modern astronomers&mdash;discoveries of
a country where he can obtain no power, and
settle no system of government&mdash;discoveries
too, which can only be procured by peeping
through glasses which few can purchase, at a
place which no man can desire to approach.
While the musical composer equally laments
the fate of the fossilist, who literally buries his
talent in the ground, and equally dead to all
the charms of taste, the transports of true
expression, and the delights of harmony,
rises with the sun only to shun his beams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and seek in the dripping caverns of the
earth the effects of his diminished influence.
The medallist has had much of this scorn to
contend with; yet he that makes it his study
to register great events, is perhaps next to him
who has contributed to their birth: and this
palace displays a degree of riches <i lang="fr">en ce genre</i>,
difficult to conceive.</p>

<p>I was, however, better entertained by
admiring the incomparable Schidonis, which
are to be found only here: he was a
scholar, or rather an imitator, of Correggio;
and what he has done seems more
the result of genius animated by observation,
than of profound thought or minute nicety;
he painted such ragged folks as he found upon
the <em>Chiaja</em>; yet his pictures differ no less from
the Dutch school, than do those which flow
from the majestic pencil of the demi-divine
Caracci and their followers, and for the same
reason; their minds reflected dignity and grace,
his eyes looked upon forms finely proportioned,
though covered with tatters, or perhaps
scarcely covered at all; no smugness, no
plumpness, no <em>vulgar</em> character, ever crossed
the fancy of Schidone; for a <i lang="it">Lazaroni</i> at
Naples, like a sailor at Portsmouth, is no mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
character, though he is a coarse one; it is in
the low Parisian, and the true-bred London
blackguard, we must look for innate baseness,
and near approaches to brutality; nor
are the Hollanders wanting in originals I trust,
when one has seen so many copies of the human
form from their hands, divested of soul
as I may say, and, like Prior’s Emma when
she resolves to ramble with her outlawed lover,</p>

<p>Here is a beautiful performance too of the
Venetian school&mdash;a resurrection of Lazarus, by
Leandro Bassano, esteemed the best performance
of that family, and full of merit&mdash;the merit of
<em>character</em> I mean; while Mary’s eyes are wholly
employed, and her mind apparently engrossed
by the Saviour’s benignity, and almighty
power; Martha thinks merely on the present
exertion of them, and only watches the deliverance
of her beloved brother from the tomb:
the restored Lazarus too&mdash;an apparent corpse,
re-awakened suddenly to a thousand sensations
at once, wonder, gratitude, and affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
delight!&mdash;How can one coldly sit to hear the
connoisseurs <em>admire the folds of the drapery</em>?
Lanfranc’s St. Michael too is a very noble
picture; and though his angel is infinitely less
angelic than that of Guido, his devil is a less
ordinary and vulgar devil than that of his
fellow-student, which somewhat too much resembles
the common peeping satyr in a landscape;
whereas Lanfranc’s Lucifer seems embued
with more intellectual vices&mdash;rage, revenge,
and ambition.</p>

<p>But I am called from my observations and
reflexions, to see what the Neapolitans call
<i lang="it">il trionfo di Policinello</i>, a person for whom
they profess peculiar value. Harlequin and
Brighella here scarcely share the fondness of
an audience, while at Venice, Milan, &amp;c.
much pleasantry is always cast into <em>their</em> characters.</p>

<p>The triumph was a pageant of prodigious
size, set on four broad wheels like our waggons,
but larger; it consisted of a pyramid of
men, twenty-eight in number, placed with
wonderful ingenuity all of one size, something
like what one has seen exhibited at Sadler’s
Wells, the Royal Circus, &amp;c.; dressed in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
uniform, viz. the white habit and puce-coloured
mask of <i lang="it">caro</i> Policinello; disposed
too with that skill which tumblers alone can
either display or describe; a single figure, still
in the same dress, crowning the whole, and
forming a point at the top, by standing fixed
on the shoulders of his companions, and playing
merrily on the fiddle; while twelve oxen
of a beautiful white colour, and trapped with
many shining ornaments, drew the whole
slowly over the city, amidst the acclamations
of innumerable spectators, that followed and
applauded the performance with shouts.</p>

<p>What I have learned from this show, and
many others of the same kind, is of no greater
value than the derivation of <em>his name</em> who is so
much the favourite of Naples: but from the
mask he appears in, cut and coloured so as
exactly to resemble a <em>flea</em>, with hook nose and
wrinkles, like the body of that animal; his
employment too, being ever ready to hop,
and skip, and jump about, with affectation
of uncommon elasticity, giving his neighbours
a sly pinch from time to time: all these circumstances,
added to the very intimate acquaintance
and connection all the Neapolitans
have with this, the least offensive of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
innumerable insects that infest them; and,
last of all, <em>his name</em>, which, corrupt it how we
please, was originally <em>Pulicinello</em>; leaves me
persuaded that the appellation is merely <em>little
flea</em>.</p>

<p>A drive to Caserta, the king’s great palace,
not yet quite finished, carries me away from
this important study, and leaves me little time
to enjoy the praises due to a discovery of so
much consequence.</p>

<p>The drive perhaps pleased us better than the
palace, which is a prodigious mass of building
indeed, and to my eye appears to cover more
space than proud Versailles itself; court within
court, and quadrangle within quadrangle; it
is an enormous bulk to be sure&mdash;not pile&mdash;for
it is not high in proportion to the surrounding
objects somehow; and being composed all of
brick, presents ideas rather of squat solidity,
than of princely magnificence. Ostentation is
expected always to strike, as elegance is known
to charm, the beholder; and space seldom
fails in its immediate effect upon the mind;
but here the <em>valley</em> (I might say <em>hole</em>) this
house is set in, looks too little for it; and
offends one in the same manner as the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
beautiful buildings do at Buxton, where from
every hill one expects to tumble down upon
the new Crescent below. The stair-case is
such, however, as I am persuaded no other
palace can shew; vastly wider than any the
French king can boast, and infinitely more
precious with regard to the marbles which
compose its sides. The immensity of it, however,
though it enhances the value, does not
do much honour to the taste of him who contrived
it. No apartments can answer the expectations
raised by such an approach; and
in fact the chapel alone is worthy an ascent so
fit for a triumphal procession, instead of a pair
of stairs. That chapel is I confess of exquisite
beauty and elegance; and there is a picture,
by Mengs, of the blessed Virgin Mary’s presentation
when a girl, that is really <i lang="fr">paitrie des
graces</i>; it scarcely can be admired or commended
enough, and one can scarcely prevail
on one’s self ever to quit it. Her marriage,
a picture on the other side, is not so
happily imagined; but it seems as if the
painter thought that joke too good to part
with, that there never was a particularly excellent
picture of a wedding; and that Poussin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
himself failed, when having represented all the
six other sacraments so admirably, that of marriage
has been found fault with by the connoisseurs
of every succeeding generation.</p>

<p>Well! if the palace at Caserta must be deemed
more heavy than handsome, I fear the gardens
must likewise be avowed to be laid out in a
manner one would rather term savage than
natural: all artifice is banished however: the
king of Naples scorns petty tricks for the
amusement of petty minds;&mdash;he turns a
whole river down his cascade,&mdash;<em>a real one</em>;
and if its formation is not of the first rate for
assuming an appearance of nature, it has the
merit of being sincerely that which others
only pretend to be: while I am told that
his architects are now employed in connecting
the great stones awkwardly disposed in two
rows down each side the torrent, with the
very rocks and mountains among which the
spring rises; if they effect this, their cascade
will, so far as ever I have read or heard, be
single in its kind.</p>

<p>Van Vittelli’s aqueduct is a prodigiously
beautiful, magnificent, and what is more, a
useful performance: having the finest models
of antiquity, he is said to have surpassed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
all. Why such superb and expensive methods
should be still used to conduct water up and
down Italy, any more than other nations, or
why they are not equally necessary in France
and England, nobody informs me. Madame
de Bocages enquired long ago, when she was
taken to see the fountain Trevi at Rome, why
they had no water at Paris but the Seine? I
think the question so natural, that one wishes
to repeat it; and one great reason, little urged
by others, incites me to look with envy on the
delicious and almost innumerable gushes of
water that cool the air of Naples and of Rome,
and pour their pellucid tides through almost
every street of those luxurious cities: <em>it is this</em>,
that I consider them as a preservative against
that dreadfullest of all maladies, canine madness;
a distemper which, notwithstanding the
excessive heat, has here scarcely a name. Sure
it is the plenty of drink the dogs meet at
every turn, that must be the sole cause of a
blessing so desirable.</p>

<p>My stay has been always much shorter than
I wished it, in every great town of Italy; but
<em>here!</em> where numberless wonders strike the
sense without fatiguing it, I do feel double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pleasure; and among all the new ideas I have
acquired since England lessened to my sight
upon the sea, those gained at Naples will be
the last to quit me. The works of art may
be found great and lovely, but the drunken
Faun and the dying Gladiator will fade from
one’s remembrance, and leave the glow of
Solfaterra and the gloom of Posilippo indelibly
impressed. Vesuvius too! that terrified
me so when first we drove into this amazing
town, what future images can ever obliterate
the thrilling sensations it at first occasioned?
Surely the sight of old friends after a tedious
absence can alone supply the vacancy that a
mind must feel which quits such sublime, such
animated scenery, and experiences a sudden
deprivation of delight, finding the bosom all
at once unfurnished of what has yielded it for
three swiftly-flown months, perpetual change
of undecaying pleasures.</p>

<p>To-morrow I shall take my last look at the
Bay, and driving forward, hope at night to
lodge at Terracina.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">JOURNEY from NAPLES to ROME.</span></h2>

<p>The morning of the day we left our fair
Parthenope was passed in recollecting her various
charms: every one who leaves her carries
off the same sensations. I have asked
several inhabitants of other Italian States what
they liked best in Italy except home; it was
Naples always, dear delightful Naples! When
I say this, I mean always to exclude those
whose particular pursuits lead them to cities
which contain the prize they press for. English
people when unprejudiced express the
like preference. Attachments formed by love
or friendship, though they give charms to
every place, cannot be admitted as a reason for
commending any one above the rest. A traveller
without candour it is vain to read; one
might as well hope to get a just view of nature
by looking through a coloured glass, as
to gain a true account of foreign countries, by
turning over pages dictated by prejudice.</p>

<p>With the nobility of Naples I had no acquaintance,
and can of course say nothing of their
manners. Those of the middling people seem
to be behind-hand with their neighbours; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is so odd that they should never yet have arrived
at calling their money by other names
than those of the weights, an <em>ounce</em> and a
<em>grain</em>; the coins however are not ugly.</p>

<p>The evening of the day we left this surprising
city was spent out of its king’s dominions,
at Terracina, which now affords one of
the best inns in Italy; it is kept by a Frenchman,
whose price, though high, is regulated,
whose behaviour is agreeable, and whose suppers
and beds are delightful. Near the spot
where his house now stands, there was in ancient
Pagan days a temple, erected to the memory
of the beardless Jupiter called Anxurus,
of which Pausanias, and I believe Scaliger too,
take notice; though the medal of Pansa is
<i lang="la">imago barbata, sed intonsa</i>, they tell me; and
Statius extends himself in describing the innocence
of Jupiter and Juno’s conversation
and connection in their early youth. Both
of them had statues of particular magnificence
venerated with very peculiar ceremonies,
erected for them in this town, however, <i lang="la">ut Anxur
fuit quæ nunc Terracinæ sunt</i><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The
tenth Thebaid too speaks much <i lang="la">de templo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sacro et Junoni puellæ, Jovis Axuro</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; and
who knows after all whether these odd circumstances
might not be the original reason
of Anxur’s grammatical peculiarity, well
known to all from the line in old <cite>Propria que

<p>This place was founded and colonised by
Æmilius Mamercus and Lucius Plautus, Anno
Mundi 3725 I think; they took the town of
Priverna, and sent each three hundred citizens
to settle this new city, where Jupiter Anxurus
was worshipped, as Virgil among so many
other writers bears testimony:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Æmilius Mamercus was a very pious consul,
and when he served before with Genutius his
colleague, made himself famous for driving
the nail into Minerva’s temple to stop the
progress of the plague; he was therefore likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
enough to encourage this superstitious worship
of the beardless Jupiter.</p>

<p>Some books of geography, very old ones,
had given me reason to make enquiry after a
poisonous fountain in the rocks near Terracina.
My enquiries were not vain. The
fountain still exists, and whoever drinks it
dies; though Martial says,</p>

<p class="noindent">The place is now cruelly unwholesome however;
so much so, that our French landlord
protests he is obliged to leave it all the summer
months, at least the very hot season, and retire
with his family to Molo di Gaeta. He
told us with rational delight enough of a visit
the Pope had made to those places some few
years ago; and that he had been heard to say
to some of his attendants how there was no
<i lang="it">mal aria</i> at all thereabouts in past days: an observation
which had much amazed them. It
was equally their wonder how his Holiness
went o’walking about with a book in his
hand or pocket, repeating verses by the sea-side.
One of them had asked the name of the
book, but nobody could remember it. “Was
it <em>Virgil</em>?” said one of our company. “<i lang="fr">Eh mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Dieu, Madame, vous l’avez divinée</i><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,” replied
the man. But, O dear (thought I), how
would these poor people have stared, if their
amiable sovereign, enlightened and elegant
as his mind is, had happened to talk more in
their presence of what he had been reading on
the sea shore, <em>Virgil</em> or <em>Homer</em>; had he
chanced to mention that <em>Molo di Gaeta</em> was in
ancient times the seat of the Lestrygones, and
inhabited by canibals, men who eat one another!
and surely it is scarcely less comical
than curious, to recollect how Ulysses expresses
his sensations on first landing just by
this now lovely and highly-cultivated spot,
when he pathetically exclaims,</p>

<p class="noindent">Poor Cicero might indeed have asked the
question seven or eight centuries after, in days

when his most inhuman murder near
this town, completed the measure of their crimes;
who to their country’s fate added that of its
philosopher, its orator, its acknowledged father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and preserver.&mdash;Cruel, ungrateful Rome! ever
crimson with the blood of its own best citizens&mdash;theatre
of civil discord and proscriptions,
unheard of in any history but her’s;
who, next to Jerusalem in sins, has been
next in sufferings too; though twice so
highly favoured by Heaven&mdash;from the dreadful
moment when all her power was at once
crushed by barbarism, and even her language
rendered <em>dead</em> among mankind&mdash;to the present
hour, when even her second splendours,
like the last gleams of an <i lang="la">aurora borealis</i>, fade
gradually from the view, and sink almost imperceptibly
into decay. Nor can the exemplary
virtues and admirable conduct of <em>this</em>,
and of her four last princes, redeem her from
ruin long threatened to her past tyrannical
offences; any more than could the merits of
Marcus Aurelius and Antoninus Pius compensate
for the crimes of Tiberius, Caligula,
and Nero.&mdash;Let the death of Cicero, which inspired

enjoining him a prayer to Crateis the mother
of Scylla, to pacify her rapacious daughter’s

<h2>ROME.</h2>

<p>We are come here just in time to see the
three last days of the carnival, and very droll
it is to walk or drive, and see the people run
about the streets, all in some gay disguise or
other, and masked, and patched, and painted to
make sport. The Corso is now quite a scene
of distraction; the coachmen on the boxes
pretending to be drunk, and throwing sugar-plumbs
at the women, which it grows hard to
find out in the crowd and confusion, as the
evening, which shuts in early, is the festive
hour: and there is some little hazard in parading
the streets, lest an accident might happen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
though a temporary rail and <i lang="fr">trottoir</i> are
erected, to keep the carriages off. Our high
joke, however, seems to consist in the men
putting on girls clothes: a woman is somewhat
a rarity at Rome, and strangely superfluous
as it should appear by the extraordinary
substitutes found for them on the stage: it is
more than wonderful to see great strong fellows
dancing the women’s parts in these fashionable
dramas, pastoral and heroic ballets
as they call them. <i lang="it">Soprano</i> singers did not so
surprise me with their feminine appearance in
the Opera; but these clumsy <i lang="it">figurantes</i>! all
stout, coarse-looking men, kicking about in
hooped petticoats, were to me irresistibly ridiculous:
the gentlemen with me however,
both Italians and English, were too much
disgusted to laugh, while <i lang="fr">la premiere danseuse</i>
acted the coquet beauty, or distracted mother,
with a black beard which no art could subdue,
and destroyed every illusion of the pantomime
at a glance. All this struck nobody but us
foreigners after all; tumultuous and often
<em>tender</em> applauses from the pit convinced us of
<em>their heart-felt</em> approbation! and in the parterre
fat gentlemen much celebrated at Rome
for their taste and refinement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>As their exhibition did not please our
party, notwithstanding its singularity, we went
but once to the theatre, except when a Festa
di Ballo was advertised to begin at eleven
o’clock one night, but detained the company
waiting on its stairs for two hours
at least beyond the time: for my own part
I was better amused <em>outside</em> the doors, than
<em>in</em>. Masquerades can of themselves give very
little pleasure except when they are new things.
What was most my delight and wonder to observe,
was the sight of perhaps two hundred
people of different ranks, all in my mind
strangely ill-treated by a nobleman; who having
a private supper in the room, prevented their
entrance who paid for admission; all mortified,
all crowded together in an inconvenient place;
all suffering much from heat, and more from
disappointment; yet all in perfect good humour
with each other, and with the gentleman who
detained in longing and ardent, but not impatiently-expressed
expectation, such a number
of <em>Romans</em>: who, as I could not avoid remarking,
certainly deserve to rule over all the
world once more, if, as we often read in history,
<em>command</em> is to be best learned from the
practice of <em>obedience</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The masquerade was carried on when we
had once begun it, with more taste and elegance
here, than either at Naples or Milan;
so it was at Florence, I remember; more dresses
of contrivance and fancy being produced.
We had a very pretty device last night, of a man
who pretended to carry statues about as if for sale:
the gentlemen and ladies who personated the
figures were incomparable from the choice of
attitudes, and skill in colouring; but <i lang="it">il carnovale
è morto</i>, as the women of quality told
us last night from their coaches, in which they
carried little transparent lanthorns of a round
form, red, blue, green, &amp;c. to help forward
the shine; and these they throw at each other
as they did sugar plums in the other towns,
while the millions of small thin bougie candles
held in every hand, and stuck up at every balcony,
make the <i lang="it">Strada del Popolo</i> as light as
day, and produce a wonderfully pretty effect,
gay, natural, and pleasing.</p>

<p>The unstudied hilarity of Italians is very rejoicing
to the heart, from one’s consciousness that it
is the result of cheerfulness really felt, not a mere
incentive to happiness hoped for. The death
of Carnovale, who was carried to his grave
with so many candles suddenly extinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at twelve o’clock last night, has restored us to a
tranquil possession of ourselves, and to an opportunity
of examining the beauties of nature
and art that surround one.</p>

<p>St. Peter’s church is incontestably the first
object in this city, so crowded with single
figures: That this church should be built in the
form of a Latin cross instead of a Greek one
may be wrong for ought I know; that columns
would have done better than piers inside,
I do not think; but that whatever has
been done by man might have been done
better, if that is all the critics want, I readily
allow. This church is, after all their objections,
nearer to perfect than any other building
in the world; and when Michael Angelo,
looking at the Pantheon, said, “Is this the best
our vaunted ancestors could do? If so, I will shew
the advancement of the art, in suspending a
dome of equal size to this up in the air.” he
made a glorious boast, and was perhaps the
only person ever existing who could have
performed his promise.</p>

<p>The figures of angels, or rather cherubims,
eight feet high, which support the vases holding
holy water, as they are made after the
form of babies, do perfectly and closely represent
infants of eighteen or twenty months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
old; nor till one comes quite close to them
indeed, is it possible to discern that they are
colossal. This is brought by some as a proof
of the exact proportions kept, and of the
prodigious space occupied, by the area of this
immense edifice; and urged by others, as a
peculiarity of the <em>human</em> body to deceive so
at a distance, most unjustly; for one is surprised
exactly in the same manner by the
doves, which ornament the church in various
parts of it. <em>They</em> likewise appear of the
natural size, and completely within one’s
reach upon entering the door, but soon as
approached, recede to a considerable height,
and prove their magnitude nicely proportioned
to that of the angels and other decorations.</p>

<p>The canopied altar, and its appurtenances,
are likewise all colossal I think, when
they tell me of four hundred and fifty thousand
pounds weight of bronze brought from
the Pantheon, and used to form the wreathed
pillars which support, and the torses that
adorn it. Yet airy lightness and exquisite
elegance are the characteristics of the fabric,
not gloomy greatness, or heavy solidity.
How immense then must be the space it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
stands on! four hundred and sixty-seven of
my steps carried me from the door to the
end. Warwick castle would be contained in
its middle <em>aisle</em>. Here are one hundred and
twenty silver lamps, each larger than I could
lift, constantly burning round the altar; and
one never sees either them, or the light they
dispense, till forced upon the observation of
them, so completely are they lost in the general
grandeur of the whole. In short, with
a profusion of wealth that astonishes, and of
splendour that dazzles, as soon as you enter
on an examination of its secondary parts,
every man’s <em>first</em> impression at entering St.
Peter’s church, must be surprise at seeing it
so clear of superfluous ornament. This is the
true character of innate excellence, the <i lang="la">simplex
munditiis</i>, or <em>freedom from decoration</em>; the
noble simplicity to which no embellishment
can add dignity, but seems a mere appendage.
Getting on the top of this stupendous
edifice, is however the readiest way to
fill one’s mind with a deserving notion of its
extent, capacity, and beauty; nor is any
operation easier, so happily contrived is the
ascent. Contrivance here is an ill-chosen
word too, so luminous so convenient is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
walk, so spacious the galleries beside, that all
idea of danger is removed, when you perceive
that even round the undefended cornice,
our king’s state coach might be most
safely driven.</p>

<p>The monuments, although incomparable,
scarcely obtain a share of your admiration
for the first ten times of your surveying the
place; Guglielmo della Porta’s famous figure,
supporting that dedicated to the memory of
Paul the Third, was found so happy an imitation
of female beauty by some madman
here however, that it is said he was inflamed
with a Pigmalion-like passion for it, of which
the Pontiff hearing, commanded the statue
to be draped. The steps at almost the end
of this church we have all heard were porphyry,
and so they are; how many hundred
feet long I have now forgotten:&mdash;no matter;
what I have not forgotten is, that I thought as
I looked at them&mdash;why so they <em>should</em> be porphyry&mdash;and
that was all. While the vases
and cisterns of the same beautiful substance at
Villa Borghese attracted my wonder; and
Clement X.’s urn at St. John de Lateran,
appeared to me an urn fitter for the ashes of
an Egyptian monarch, Busiris or Sesostris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
than for a Christian priest or sovereign, since
universal dominion has been abolished. Nothing,
however, <em>can</em> look very grand in St.
Peter’s church; and though I saw the general
benediction given (I hope partook it)
upon Easter day, my constant impression was,
that the people were below the place; no
pomp, no glare, no dove and glory on the
chair of state, but what looked too little for
the area that contained them. Sublimity disdains
to catch the vulgar eye, she elevates the
soul; nor can long-drawn processions, or
splendid ceremonies, suffice to content those
travellers who seek for images that never tarnish,
and for truths that never can decay.
Pius Sextus, in his morning dress, paying his
private devotions at the altar, without any
pageantry, and with very few attendants,
struck me more a thousand and a thousand
times, than when arrayed in gold, in colours,
and diamonds, he was carried to the front of
a balcony big enough to have contained the
conclave; and there, shaded by two white
fans, which, though really enormous, looked
no larger than that a girl carries in her pocket,
pronounced words which on account of the
height they came from were difficult to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is known and felt by the managers
of these theatrical exhibitions so certainly, that
they judiciously confine great part of them to
the <i lang="it">Capella Sestini</i>, which being large enough
to impress the mind with its solemnity, and
not spacious enough for the priests, congregation,
and all, to be lost in it, is well adapted
for those various functions that really make
Rome a scene of perpetual gala during the
holy week; which an English friend here
protested to me he had never spent with so
little devotion in his life before. The <i lang="la">miserere</i>
has, however, a strong power over one’s
mind&mdash;the absence of all instrumental music,
the steadiness of so many human voices, the
gloom of the place, the picture of Michael
Angelo’s last judgment covering its walls,
united with the mourning dress of the spectators&mdash;is
altogether calculated with great ingenuity
to give a sudden stroke to the imagination,
and kindle that temporary blaze of
devotion it is wisely enough intended to excite:
but even this has much of its effect destroyed,
from the admission of too many
people: crowd and bustle, and struggle for
places, leave no room for any ideas to range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
themselves, and least of all, serious ones: nor
would the opening of our sacred music in
Westminster Abbey, when nine hundred performers
join to celebrate <em>Messiah</em>’s praises,
make that impression which it does upon the
mind, were not the king, and court, and all
the audience, as still as death, when the first
note is taken.</p>

<p>The ceremony of washing the pilgrims feet
is a pleasing one: it is seen in high perfection
here at Rome; where all that the pope personally
performs is done with infinite grace,
and with an air of mingled majesty and sweetness,
difficult to hit, but singularly becoming
in him, who is both priest of God, and sovereign
of his people.</p>

<p>But how, said Cyrus, shall I make men
think me more excellent than themselves? <em>By
being really so</em>, replies Xenophon, putting his
words into the mouth of Cambyses. Pius
Sextus takes no deeper method I believe, yet
all acknowledge his superiour merit: No
prince can less affect state, nor no clergyman
can less adopt hypocritical behaviour. The
Pope powders his hair like any other of the
Cardinals, and is, it seems, the first who has
ever done so. When he takes the air it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a fashionable carriage, with a few, a very few
guards on horseback, and is by no means desirous
of making himself a shew. Now and
then an old woman begs his blessing as he
passes; but I almost remember the time when
our bishops of Bangor and St. Asaph were
followed by the country people in North
Wales full as much or more, and with just
the same feelings. One man in particular
we used to talk of, who came from a distant
part of our mountainous province, with much
expence in proportion to his abilities, poor
fellow, and terrible fatigue; he was a tenant
of my father’s, who asked him how he ventured
to undertake so troublesome a journey?
It was to get my good Lord’s blessing, replied
the farmer, <em>I hope it will cure my rheumatism</em>.
Kissing the slipper at Rome will probably, in
a hundred years more, be a thing to be thus
faintly recollected by a few very old people;
and it is strange to me it should have lasted so
long. No man better knows than the present
learned and pious successor of St. Peter, that
St. Peter himself would permit no act of adoration
to his own person; and that he severely
reproved Cornelius for kneeling to him, charging
him to rise and stand upon his feet, adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
these remarkable words, <em>seeing I also am a
man</em><a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Surely it will at last be found out
among them that such a ceremony is inconsistent
with the Pope’s character as a Christian
priest, however it may suit state matters
to continue it in the character of a sovereign.
The road he is now making on every side his
capital to facilitate foreigners approach, the
money he has laid out on the conveniencies
of the Vatican, the desire he feels of reforming
a police much in want of reformation, joined
to an immaculate character for private virtue
and an elegant taste for the fine arts, must
make every one wish for a long continuance
of his health and dignity; though the wits
and jokers, when they see his arms up, as they
are often placed in galleries, &amp;c. about the
palace, and consist of a zephyr blowing on a
flower, a pair of eagle’s wings, and a few stars,
have invented this Epigram, to say that when
the Emperor has got his eagle back, the King of
France his fleurs de lys, and the stars are gone
to heaven, Braschi will have nothing left him
but the <em>wind</em>:</p>

<p class="noindent">These verses were given me by an agreeable
Benedictine Friar, member of a convent belonging
to St. Paul’s <i lang="it">fuor delle mura</i>; he was
a learned man, a native of Ragusa, had been
particularly intimate with Wortley Montague,
whose variety of acquirements had impressed
him exceedingly.</p>

<p>He shewed us the curiosities of his church,
the finest in Rome next to St. Peter’s, and had
silver gates; but the plating is worn off and
only the brass remains. There is an old Egyptian
candlestick above five feet high preserved
here, and many other singularities adorn the
church. The Pillars are 136 in number, all
marble, and each consisting of one unjoined
and undivided piece; 40 of these are fluted,
and two which did belong to a temple of Mars
are seven feet and a half each in diameter.
Here is likewise the place where Nero ran for
refuge to the house of his freed-man, and in
the cloister a stone, with this inscription on it,</p>

<p class="noindent">Here is an altar supported by four pillars of
red porphyry, and here are the pictures of all
the popes; St. Peter first, and our present Braschi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
last. It has given much occasion for chat
that there should now be no room left to hang
a successor’s portrait, and that he who now
occupies the chair is painted in powdered hair
and a white head-dress, such as he wears every
day, to the great affliction of his courtiers, who
recommended the usual state diadem; but “No,
no,” said he, “there have been <em>red cap Popes</em>
enough, mine shall be only white,” and <em>white it is</em>.</p>

<p>This beautiful edifice was built by the
Emperor Theodosius, and there is an old
picture at the top, of our Saviour giving the
benediction in the form that all the Greek
priests give it now. Apropos, there have
been many sects of Oriental Christians dropt
into the Church of Rome within these late
years; a very venerable old Armenian says
Greek mass regularly in St. Peter’s church
every day before one particular altar; his long
black dress and white beard attracted much of
my notice; he saw it did, and now whenever
we meet in the street by chance he kindly
stands still to bless me. But the Syriac or
Maronites have a church to themselves just
by the <i lang="it">Bocca della Verita</i>; and extremely curious
we thought it to see their ceremonies upon
Palm Sunday, when their aged patriarch, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
less than ninety-three years old, and richly attired
with an inconvenient weight of drapery, and
a mitre shaped like that of Aaron in our Bibles
exactly, was supported by two olive coloured
orientals, while he pronounced a benediction on
the tree that stood near the altar, and was at least
ten feet high. The attendant clergy, habited
after their own eastern taste, and very superbly,
had broad phylacteries bound on their foreheads
after the fashion of the Jews, and carried long
strips of parchment up and down the church,
with the law written on them in Syriac characters,
while they formed themselves into a
procession and led their truly reverend principal
back to his place. An exhibition so
striking, with the view of many monuments
round the walls, sacred to the memory of
such, and such a bishop of Damascus, gave so
strong an impression of Asiatic manners to the
mind, that one felt glad to find Europe round
one at going out again. One of the treasures
much renowned in it we have seen to-day,
the transfiguration painted by Rafaelle; it was
the <em>first</em> thing the Emperor <em>did</em> visit when he
came to Rome, and so a Franciscan Friar who
shews it, told us. He saw a gentleman walk
into church it seems, and leaving his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
at dinner, went out to converse with him.
“<em>Pull aside the curtain, Sir</em>,” said the stranger,
“<em>for I am in haste to see this master-piece of
your immortal Raphael</em>.” I was as willing to be
in a hurry as he, says the Friar, and observed
how fortunate it was for us that it could not
be moved, otherwise we had lost it long ago;
for, Sir, said I, they would have carried it away
from poor <i lang="it">Monte Citoria</i> to some finer
temple long ago; though, let me tell you, this
is an elegant Doric building too, and one of
Bramante’s best works, much admired by the
English in particular. I hope, if it please God
now that I should live but a very little longer,
I may have the honour of shewing it <em>the Emperor</em>.
“Is he expected?” enquired the
gentleman. “Every day, Sir,” replies the Friar.
“And <em>well now</em>,” cries the foreigner, “what
sort of a man do you expect to see?” “Why,
Sir, you seem a traveller, did <em>you</em> ever see him?”
quoth the Franciscan. “Yes, sure, my good
friend, very often indeed, he is as plain a man
as myself, has good intentions, and an honest
heart; and I think you would like him if you
knew him, because he puts nobody out of
their way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>This dialogue, natural and simple, had taken
such hold of our good <i lang="fr">religieux</i>’s fancy, that
not a word would he say about the picture,
while his imagination was so full of the prince,
and of his own amazement at the salutation
of his companions, when returning to the refectory;&mdash;“Why,
Gaetano,” cried they, “thou
hast been conversing with <em>Cæsar</em>:”&mdash;I too
liked the tale, because it was artless, and because
it was true. But the picture surpasses
all praise; the woman kneeling on the fore-ground,
her back to the spectators, seems a
repetition of the figure in Raphael’s famous
picture of the Vatican on fire, that is shewn in
the chambers called particularly by his name;
where the personifications of Justice and Meekness,
engraved by Strange, seize one’s attention
very forcibly; it is observable, that the
first is every body’s favourite in the painting,
the last in the engraving.</p>

<p>Raphael’s Bible, as one of the long galleries
is comically called by the connoisseurs,
breaks one’s neck to look at it. The stories,
beginning with Adam and Eve, are painted in
small compartments; the colouring as vivid
now as if it were done last week; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
<i lang="fr">arabesques</i> so gay and pretty, they are very
often represented on fans; and we have fine
engravings in England of all, yet, though exquisitely
done, they give one somehow a false
notion of the whole: so did Piranesi’s prints
too, though invaluable, when considered by
themselves as proofs of the artist’s merit. His
judicious manner, however, of keeping all
coarse objects from interfering with the grand
ones, though it mightily increases the dignity,
and adds to the spirit of his performance, is
apt to lead him who wishes for information,
into a style of thinking that will at last produce
disappointment as to general appearances,
which here at Rome is really disproportionate
to the astonishing productions of
art contained within its walls.</p>

<p>But I must leave this glorious Vatican, with
the perpetual regret of having seen scarcely
any thing of its invaluable library, except the
prodigious size and judicious ornaments of it:
neither book nor MS. could I prevail on the
librarian to shew me, except some love-letters
from Henry the Eighth of England to Anne
Boleyn, which he said were most likely to interest
<em>me</em>: they were very gross and indecent
ones to be sure; so I felt offended, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
went away, in a very ill humour, to see Castle
St. Angelo; where the emperor Adrian intended
perpetually to repose; but the urn
containing his ashes is now kept in a garden
belonging to one of the courts in the palace,
near the Apollo and other Greek statues of peculiar
excellence. From his tomb too, some
of the pillars of St. Paul’s were taken, and this
splendid mausolæum converted into a sort of
citadel, where Sixtus Quintus deposited three
millions of gold, it is said; and Alexander the
Sixth retired to shield himself from Charles
the Eighth of France, who entered Rome by
torch-light in 1494, and forced the Pope to
give him what the French historians call
<i lang="fr">l’investiture du royaume de Naples</i>; after which
he took Capua, and made his conquering
entry into Naples the February following,
1495; Ferdinand, son of Alphonso, flying
before him. This Pope was the father of the
famous Cæsar Borgia; and it was on this occasion,
I believe, that the French wits made
the well-known distich on his notorious avarice
and rapacity:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>This Castle St. Angelo went once, I believe,
under the name of the Ælian Bridge,
when the emperor Adrian first fixed his mind
on making a monument for himself there.
The soldiers of Belisarius are said to have destroyed
numberless statues which then adorned
it, by their odd manner of defending the place
from the Gothic assaulters. It is now a sort
of tower for the confinement of state prisoners;
and decorated with many well-painted,
but ill-kept pictures of Polydore and Julio
Romano.</p>

<p>The fireworks exhibited here on Easter-day
are the completest things of their kind in
the world; three thousand rockets, all sent up
into the air at once, make a wonderful burst
indeed, and serve as a pretty imitation of Vesuvius:
the lighting up of the building too
on a sudden with fire-pots, had a new and
beautiful effect; we all liked the entertainment
vastly.</p>

<p>I looked here for what some French <i lang="fr">recueil</i>,
<em>Menagiana</em> if I remember rightly, had taught
me to expect; this was some brass cannon belonging
to Christina queen of Sweden, who
had caused them to be cast, and added an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
engraving on them with these remarkable
words;</p>

<p class="noindent">No such thing, however, could be found or
heard of. Indeed a search after truth requires
such patience, such penetration, and such
learning, that it is no wonder she is so seldom
got a glimpse of; whoever is diligently desirous
to find her, is so perplexed by ignorance,
so retarded by caution, so confounded
by different explications of the same thing recurring
at every turn, so sickened with silly
credulity on the one hand, and so offended
with pertness and pyrrhonism on the other,
that it is fairly rendered impossible for one to
keep clear of prejudices, while the steady resolution
to do so becomes itself a prejudice.&mdash;But
with regard to little follies, it is better to
laugh at than lament them.</p>

<p>We were shewn one morning lately the
spot where it is supposed St. Paul suffered
decapitation; and our <i lang="it">Cicerone</i> pointed out to
us three fountains, about the warmth of Buxton,
Matlock, or Bristol water, which were
said to have burst from the ground at the
moment of his martyrization. A Dutch gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in company, and a steady Calvinist,
loudly ridiculed the tradition, called it an idle
tale, and triumphantly expressed his <em>certain
conviction</em>, that such an event <em>could not possibly</em>
have ever taken place. To this assertion no
reply was made; and as we drove home all
together, the conversation having taken a
wide range and a different turn, he related in
the course of it a long Rousseau-like tale of a
lady he once knew, who having the strongest
possible attachment to one lover, married another
upon principles of filial obedience, still
retaining inviolate her passion for the object
of her choice, who, adorned with every excellence
and every grace, continued a correspondence
with her across the Atlantic ocean;
having instantly changed his hemisphere, not
to give the husband disturbance; who on his
part admired their letters, many of which were
written in <em>his</em> praise, who had so cruelly interrupted
their felicity. Seeing some marks
of disbelief in my countenance, he begun observing,
in an altered tone of voice, that <em>common</em>
and <em>vulgar</em> minds might hold such events
to be out of possibility, and such sentiments
to be out of nature, but it was only because
they were <em>above</em> the <em>comprehension</em> and beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the reach of people educated in large and corrupt
capitals, Paris, Rome, or London, to think
true. Now was not some share of good
breeding (best learned in great capitals perhaps)
necessary to prevent one from retorting
upon such an orator&mdash;that it was more likely
nature should have been permitted to deviate
in favour of Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ,
than of a fat inhabitant of North Zealand, no
way distinguished from the mass of mankind?</p>

<p>But we have been called to pass some moments
on the Cælian hill; and see the <i lang="it">Chiesa
di San Gregorio</i>, interesting above all others
to travellers who delight in the vestiges of
Pagan Rome: as, having been built upon a
Patrician’s house, it still to a great degree retains
the form of one; while to the scholar who
is pleased with anecdotes of ecclesiastical history,
the days recur when the stone chair
they shew us, contented the meek and venerable
bishop of Rome who sate in it, while
his gentle spirit sought the welfare of every
Christian, and refused to persecute even the
benighted and unbelieving Jews; opposing
only the arms of piety and prayer, to the few
enemies his transcendent excellence had raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
him. His picture here is considered as a
master-piece of Annibale Caracci; and it is
strange to think that the trial-pieces, as they
are called, should be erroneously treated of in
the Carpenteriana: when speaking of the
contention between the two scholars, to decide
which the master sent for an old woman,
Monsieur de Carpentier tells us the dispute lay
between Domenichino and Albano&mdash;a gross
mistake; as it was Guido, not Albano, who
ventured to paint something in rivalry with
Domenichino, relative to St. Andrew and his
martyrdom; and these trial-pieces produced
from her the same preference given by every
spectator who has seen them since; for when
Caracci (unwilling to offend either of his scholars,
as both were men of the highest rank
and talents) enquired of <em>her</em> what <em>she</em> thought
of Guido’s performance?&mdash;“Indeed,” replied
the old woman, “I have never yet looked at
it, so fully has my mind been occupied by the
powers shewn in that of Domenichino.”</p>

<p>The <i lang="it">vecchia</i> is here at Rome the common
phrase when speaking of your only female servant,
a person not unlike an Oxford or Cambridge
bed-maker in appearance; and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
amazed was I two days ago at the answer of
<em>our</em> <i lang="it">vecchia</i>, when curiosity prompted me to
ask her age:&mdash;“<em>O, Madam, I am a very aged
woman</em>,” was the reply, “<em>and have two
grandchildren married; I am forty-two years
old, <span class="antiqua" lang="it">poveretta me!</span></em>” I told an Italian gentleman
who dined with us what Caterina had
said, and begged him to ask the <i lang="fr">laquais de
place</i>, who waited on us at table, a similar
question. He appeared a large, well-looking,
sturdy fellow, about thirty-eight years old;
but said he was scarce twenty-two; that he
had been married six years, and had five children.
How old was your wife when you
met?&mdash;“Thirteen, Sir,” answered Carlo: so
all is kept even at least; for if they end life
sooner than in colder climates, they begin it
earlier it is plain.</p>

<p>Yet such things seem strange to <em>us</em>; so do
a thousand which occur in these warm countries
in the commonest life. Brick floors, for
example, with hangings of a dirty printed
cotton, affording no bad shelter for spiders,
bugs, &amp;c.; a table in the same room, encrusted
with <i lang="fr">verd antique</i>, very fine and worthy of
Wilton house; with some exceeding good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
copies of the finest pictures here at Rome;
form the furniture of our present lodging:
and now we have got the little casement windows
clean to look at it, I pass whole hours
admiring, even in the copy, our glorious descent
from the cross, by Daniel de Volterra;
which to say truth loses less than many a great
performance of the same kind, because its
merits consist in composition and design; and
as sentiment, not style, is translatable, so
grouping and putting figures finely together
can be easier transmitted by a copy, than the
meaner excellencies of colouring and finishing.
Homer and Cervantes may be enjoyed
by those who never learned their language, at
least to a great degree; while a true taste of
Gray’s Odes or Martial’s Epigrams has been
hitherto found exceedingly difficult to communicate.
It would, however, be cruel to
deny the merit of colouring to Daniel de Volterra’s
descent from the cross, only because
being painted in fresco it has suffered so terribly
by time and want of care, but it is now
kept covered, and they remove the curtain
when any body desires to contemplate its various
beauties.</p>

<p>The church of Santa Maria Maggiore has
been too long unspoken of, rich as it is with
the first gold torn from the unfortunate aborigines
of America; a present from Ferdinand
and Isabella of Spain to the Pope, in return
for that permission he had given them to
exert and establish their sanguinary sway over
those luckless nations. One pillar from the
temple of Peace is an ill-adapted ornament to
this edifice, built nearly in the form of an
ancient <i lang="it">basilica</i>; and with so expensive a
quantity of gilding, that it is said two hundred
and fifty thousand pounds were expended
on one chapel only, which is at last inferior
in fame and beauty to <i lang="it">cappella Corsini</i>; in
riches and magnificence to <i lang="it">cappella Borghese</i>,
where an amethyst frame of immense value
surrounds the names, in gold cypher, of our
blessed Saviour and his Mother, the ground
of which is of transparent jasper, and cannot
be matched for elegance or perfection, being
at least four feet high (the tablets I mean),
and three feet wide. But to this Borghese
family, I am well persuaded, it would be a
real fatigue to count the wealth which they
enjoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Villa Pamphili is a lovely place, or might
be made so; but laying out pleasure grounds
is not the forte of Italian taste. I never saw
one of them, except Lomellino of Genoa, who
had higher notions of a garden than what an
opera scene affords; and that is merely a range
of trees in great pots with gilded handles, and
rows of tall cypresses planted one between
every two pots, all straight over against each
other in long lines; with an octangular marble
bason to hold water in the middle, covered
for the most part with a thick green scum.</p>

<p>At Villa Pamphili is a picture of Sanctorius,
who made the weighing balance spoken of by
Addison in the Spectator; it was originally
contrived for the Pamphili Pope. And here is
an old statue of Clodius profaning the mysteries
of the Bona Dea, as we read in the Roman
history. And here are camels working in the
park like horses: we found them playing
about at their leisure when we were at Pisa,
and at Milan they were shewed for a show;
so little does one state of Italy connect with
another. These three cities cannot possibly
be much further from each other than London,
York, and Exeter; yet the manners differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
entirely, and what is done in one place is not
known at all in the other. It must be remembered
that they are all separate states.</p>

<p>At the Farnesini palace our amusements were
of a nature very contrary to this; but every
place produces amusement when one is willing
to be pleased. After looking over the
various and inestimable productions of art
contained there, we came at last to the celebrated
marriage of Alexander’s Roxana;
where, say some of the books of description,
the world’s greatest hero is represented by
Europe’s greatest painter. Some French gentlemen
were in our company, and looking
steadily at the picture for a while, one of them
exclaimed, “<i lang="fr">A la fin voila ce qui est vrayment
noble; cet Alexandre là; il paroit effectivement
le roy de France même</i><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.”</p>

<p>The Spada palace boasts Guercino’s Dido,
so disliked by the critics, who say she looks
spitted; but extremely esteemed by those that
understand its merit in other respects. There
is also the very statue kept at this palace, at
the feet of which Cæsar fell when he was
assassinated at the capitol: those who shew it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
never fail to relate his care to die gracefully;
which was likewise the last desire that
occupied Lucretia’s mind: Augustus too,
justly considering his life as scenical, desired
the <i lang="la">plaudits</i> of his friends at its conclusion:
and even Flavius Vespasian, a plain man as
one should think during a pretty large portion
of his existence, wished at last to <em>die like
an emperor</em>. That this statue of Pompey
should have been accidentally found with the
head lying in one man’s ground and the body
in another, is curious enough: a rage for appropriation
gets the better of all the love of
arts; so the contending parties (like the sisters
in David Simple, with their fine-worked carpet)
fairly severed the statue, and took home
each his half; the proprietor of this palace
meanwhile purchased the two pieces, stuck
them once more together, and here they are.&mdash;Pity
but the sovereign had carried both off
for himself.&mdash;Pius Sextus however is not so
disposed: he has had a legacy left him within
these last years, to the prejudice of some nobleman’s
heirs; who loudly lamented <em>their
fate</em>, and <em>his tyranny</em> who could take advantage,
as they expressed it, of their relation’s caprice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The Pope did not give it them back,
because they behaved so ill, he said; but neither
did he seize what was left him, by dint
of despotic authority; <em>he went to law</em> with
the family for it, which I thought a very
strange thing; <em>and lost his cause</em>, which I
thought a still stranger.</p>

<p>We have just been to see his gardens; they
are poor things enough; and the device of
representing Vulcan’s cave with the Cyclops,
in <em>water</em>-works, was more worthy of Ireland
than Rome! Monte Cavallo is however a
palace of prodigious dignity; the pictures
beyond measure excellent; his collection of
china-ware valuable and tasteful, and there
are two Mexican jars that can never be
equalled.</p>

<p>Villa Albani is the most dazzling of any
place yet however; and the caryatid pillars
the finest things in it, though replete with
wonders, and distracting with objects each
worthy a whole day’s attention. Here is an
antique list of Euripides’s plays in marble, as
those tell me who can read the Greek inscriptions;
I lose infinite pleasure every day, for
want of deeper learning. Pillars not only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<i lang="it">giall’ antique</i>, but of <i lang="it">paglia</i><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, which no house
but this possesses, amaze and delight <i lang="la">indocti
doctique</i> though; the Vatican itself cannot
shew such: a red marble mask here, three
feet and a half in diameter, is unrivalled;
they tell you it is worth its own weight in
louis d’ors: a canopus in basalt too; and cameos
by the thousand.</p>

<p>Mengs should have painted a more elegant
Apollo for the centre of such a gallery; but
his muses make amends; the Viaggiana says
they are all portraits, but I could get nobody
to tell me whose. The Abbé Winckelman,
who if I recollect aright lost his life by his
passion for <i lang="it">virtù</i>, arranged this stupendous
collection, in conjunction with the cardinal,
whose taste was by all his contemporaries
acknowledged the best in Rome.</p>

<p>We were carried this morning to a cabinet
of natural history belonging to another cardinal,
but it did not answer the account given
of it by our conductors.</p>

<p>What has most struck me here as a real
improvement upon social and civil life, was
the school of Abate Sylvester, who, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
plan of Monsieur L’Epée at Paris, teaches the
deaf and dumb people to speak, read, write,
and cast accounts; he likewise teaches them
the principles of logic, and instructs them in
the sacred mysteries of our holy religion. I
am not naturally credulous, nor apt to take
payment in words for meanings; much of
my <em>life</em> has been spent, and all my <em>youth</em>, in
the tuition of babies; I was of course less
likely to be deceived; and I can safely say,
that they did appear to have learned all he
taught them: that appearance too, if it were
no more, is so difficult to obtain, the patience
required from the master is so very great, and
the good he is doing to mankind so extensive,
that I did not like offensively to detect the difference
between <em>knowing</em> a syllogism and <em>appearing</em>
to know it. With regard to morality,
the pupils have certainly gained many præcognita.
While the capital scholars were shewing
off to another party, I addressed a girl
who sat working in the window, and perceived
that she could explain the meaning of the
commandments competently well. To prove the
truth, I pretended to pick a gentleman’s pocket
who stood near me; <i lang="it">peccato!</i> said the wench
distinctly; she was about ten years old perhaps:
but a little boy of seven was deservedly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
master’s favourite; he really possessed the most
intelligent and interesting countenance I ever
saw, and when to explain the major, minor, and
consequence, he put the two first together into
his hat with an air of triumph, we were enchanted
with him. Some one to teize him
said he had red hair; he instantly led them to
a picture of our Saviour which hung in the
room, said it was the same colour of his, and
ought to be respected.</p>

<p>Surely it is little to the credit of us English,
that this worthy Abbé Sylvester should
have a stipend from government; that Monsieur
L’Epée de Paris should be encouraged
in the same good work; that Mr. Braidwood’s
Scotch pupils should justly engage every one’s
notice&mdash;while <em>we sleep!</em> A friend in company
seeing me fret at this, asked me if I, or any
one else, had ever seen or heard of a person
really qualified for the common duties of society
by any of these professors;&mdash;“That a
deaf and dumb man should understand how
to discourse about the hypostatic union,”
added he, “I will not desire; but was there
ever known in Paris, Edinburgh, or Rome,
a deaf and dumb shoemaker, carpenter, or taylor?
Or did ever any watchmaker, fishmonger,
or wheelwright, ever keep and willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
employ a deaf and dumb journeyman?”&mdash;Nobody
replied; and we went on our way
to see what was easier decided upon and understood&mdash;the
tomb of Raphael at the Pantheon.</p>

<p>Among the many tours that have been
written, a musical tour, an astronomical tour,
&amp;c. I wonder we have never had a sepulchral
tour, making the tombs of famous men its object
of attention. That Raphael, Caracci, with
many more people of eminence, sleep at the
Pantheon, is however but a secondary consideration;
few can think of the monuments in
this church, till they have often contemplated
its architecture, which is so finely proportioned
that on first entering you think it
smaller than it really is: the pillars are enormous,
the shafts all of one piece, the composition
Egyptian granite; these are the sixteen
which support the portico built by Agrippa;
whose car, adorned with trophies and drawn
by brazen horses, once decorated the pediment,
where the holes formed by the cramps
which fastened it are still visible. Genseric
changed the gate, and connoisseurs know not
where he placed that which Agrippa made:
the present gate is magnificent, but does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
fit the place; much of the brass plating was
removed by Urban the Eighth, and carried to
St. Peter’s: he was the Barberini pope; and
of him the people said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="la">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Barbarini faciunt barbara, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He was a poet however, and could make epigrams
himself; there is a very fine edition of
his poems printed at Paris under the title of
<cite>Maffei Barberini Poemata</cite>; and such was his
knowledge of Greek literature, that he was
called the Attic bee. The drunken faun asleep
at Palazzo Barberini, by some accounted the
first statue in Rome, we owe wholly to his
care in its preservation.</p>

<p>But the Pantheon must not be quitted
till we have mentioned its pavement, where
the precious stones are not disposed, as in
many churches, without taste or care, apparently
by chance; here all is inlaid, so as
to enchant the eye with its elegance, while
it dazzles one with its riches: the black
porphyry, in small squares, disposed in
compartments, and inscribed as one may
call it in pavonazzino perhaps; the red,
bounded by serpentine; the granites, in giall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
antique, have an undescribable effect; no
Florence table was ever so beautiful: nor can
we here regret the caryatid pillars said by
Pliny to have graced this temple in his time;
while the four prodigious columns, two of
Egyptian granite, two of porphyry, still remain,
and replace them so very well. Montiosius,
who sought for the pillars said by
Pliny to have been placed by Diogenes, an
Athenian architect, as supporters of this
temple, relates however, that in the year
1580 he saw four of them buried in the
ground as high as their shoulders: but it does
not seem a tale much attended to; though I
confess my own desire of digging, as he points
out the place so exactly, on the right hand
side of the portico. The best modern caryatids
are in the old Louvre at Paris, done by
Goujon; but those of Villa Albani are true
antiques, perfect in beauty, inestimable in
value.</p>

<p>The church that now stands where a temple
to Bacchus was built, <i lang="it">fuori delle mura</i>, engaged
our attention this morning. Nothing can be
fresher than the old decorations in honour of
this jocund deity; the figures of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
women carrying grapes, oxen drawing barrels,
&amp;c. all the progress of a gay and plenteous
vintage; a sacrifice at the end. I forget
to whom the church is now dedicated, but <em>it is</em>
a church; and from under it has been dug
up a sarcophagus, all of one piece of red porphyry,
which represents on its sides a Bacchanalian
triumph; the coffin is nine feet
long, and the Pope intends removing it to the
Vatican, as a companion to that of Scipio
Æmilianus, found a few months ago; his name
engraven on it, and his bones inside. Before
the proper precautions could be taken however,
<em>they</em> were flung away by mistaken zeal
and prejudice; but an Englishman, say they,
who loves an unbeliever, got possession of a
<em>tooth</em>: meantime the ashes of the emperor
Adrian, who, as Eusebius tells us, set up the
figure of a swine on the gates of Bethlehem,
built a temple in honour of Venus, on Mount
Calvary; another to Jupiter, upon the hill
whence our Saviour ascended into heaven in
sight of his disciples;&mdash;<em>his</em> ashes are kept in
a gilt pine-apple, brought from Castle St.
Angelo, and preserved among other rarities
in the Pope’s musæum. So poor Scipio’s remains
needed not to have been treated worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
than <em>his</em>, as we know not how good a Christian
he might have made, had he lived but
150 years later: we are sure that he was a
wise and a warlike man; that he fulfilled the
scriptures unwittingly by burning Carthage;
and that he protected Polybius, whom he
would scarcely suffer out of his sight.</p>

<p>After looking often at the pictures of St.
Sebastian, I have now seen his church founded
by Constantine: he lies here in white marble,
done by Bernini; and here are more marvellous
columns.&mdash;I am tired of looking out
words to express their various merits.</p>

<p>The catacombs attract me more strongly;
here, and here alone, can one obtain a just
idea of the melancholy lives, and dismal
deaths, endured by those who first dared at
Rome to profess a religion inoffensive and
beneficial to all mankind. San Filippo Neri
has his body somewhat distinguished from the
rest of these old pious Christians, among
whom he lived to a surprising age, making a
cave his residence. Relics are now dug up
every day from these retreats, and venerated
as having once belonged to martyrs murdered
for their early attachment to a belief now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
happily displayed over one quarter of the
world, and making daily progress in another
not discovered when those heroic mortals died
to attest its truth. There is however great
danger of deception in digging out the relics,
these catacombs having been in Trajan’s time
made a burial-place for slaves; and such it
continued to be during the reign of those
Roman emperors who despised rather than
persecuted the new religion in its infancy.
The consciousness of this fact should cure the
passion many here shew for relics, the authenticity
of which can never be ascertained.
Those shewn to the people in St. Peter’s
church one evening in the holy week, all
came from here it seems; and loudly do our
Protestant travellers exclaim at their idolatry
who kneel during the exposure; though for
my life I cannot see how the custom is <em>idolatrous</em>.
He who at the moment a dead martyr’s
robe is shewn him, begs grace of God to follow
that great example, is certainly doing no
harm, or in any wise contradicting the rules
of our Anglican church, whose collects for
every saint’s day express a like supplication
for power to imitate that saint’s good example;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
if once they worship the relics indeed, it
were better they were burned; and to say
true, they should not be exposed without a
sermon explaining their use, lest vulgar minds
might be unhappily misled to mistake the real
end of their exposure, and profanely substitute
the creature for the Creator. Meanwhile no
one has a right to ridicule the love of what
once belonged to a favourite character, who
has ever felt attachment to a dead friend’s
snuff-box, or desire of possessing Scipio Æmilianus’s
tooth.</p>

<p>But the best effort to excite temporary devotion,
and commemorate sacred seasons, was
the illuminated cross upon Good Friday night,
depending from the high dome of St. Peter’s
church; where its effect upon the architecture
is strangely powerful, so large are the masses
both of light and shade; whilst the sublime
images raised in one’s mind by its noble simplicity
and solitary light, hover before the
fancy, and lead recollection round through a
thousand gloomy and mysterious passages,
with no unsteady pace however, while she follows
the rays which beam from the Redeemer’s
cross. Being obliged indeed to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with company to these solemnities, takes off
from their effect, and turns imagination into
another channel, disagreeably enough, but it
must be so; where there is a thing to be seen
every one will go to see it, and that which was
intended to produce sensations of gladness,
gratitude, or wonder, ends <em>in being a show</em>.
The consciousness of this fact only kept me
from wishing to see the Duomo di Milano, or
the cathedral of Canterbury illuminated just
so, with lamps placed in rows upon a plain
wooden cross; which surely would have, upon
those old Gothic structures, an unequalled
effect as to the forming of light and shadow.</p>

<p>But let us wish for any thing now rather
than a <em>fine sight</em>. I am tired with the very
word <em>a sight</em>; while the Jesuits church here
at Rome, with the figure of St. Ignatius all
covered with precious stones, with bronze
angels by Bernini, and every decoration that
money can purchase and industry collect, rather
dazzles than delights one, I think.</p>

<p>The Italians seem to find out, I know not
why, that it is a good thing the Jesuits are gone;
though they steadily endeavour to retain those
principles of despotism which it was their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
peculiar province to inspire and confirm, and
whilst all men must see that the work of education
goes on worse in other hands. Indeed
nothing can be wilder than committing youth
to the tuition of monks and nuns, unless, like
them, they were intended for the cloister.
Young people are but too ready to find fault
with their teachers, and these are given into
the hands of those teachers who have a fault
<em>ready found</em>. Every christian, every moral
instruction driven into their tender minds,
weakens with the experience that he or she
who inculcated it was a recluse; and that they
who are to live in the world forsooth, must
have more enlarged notions: whereas, to a
Jesuit tutor, no such objection could be made;
they were themselves men of the world, their
institution not only permitted but obliged them
to mingle with mankind, to study characters,
to attend to the various transactions passing
round them, and take an active part. It was
indeed this spirit pushed too far, which undid
and destroyed their order, so useful to the
church of Rome. Connections with various
nations they found best obtained by commerce,
and the sweets of commerce once tasted, what
body of men has been yet able to relinquish?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
But the principles of trade are formed in direct
opposition to that spirit of subordination by
which alone <em>their</em> existence could continue; and
it is unjust to charge any single event or person
with the dissolution of a body, incompatible
with that state of openness and freedom to
which Europe is hastening. Incorporated
societies too carry, like individuals, the seeds
of their own destruction in their bosoms;</p>

<p class="noindent">Every warehouse opened in every part of
Europe, every settlement obtained abroad, facilitated
their undoing, by loosening the band
which tied them close together. Extremes
can never keep their distance from each other,
while human affairs trot but in a circle; and
surely no stronger proof of that position can
be found, than the sight of Quakers in Pensylvania,
and Jesuits in Paraguay, who lived
with their converted Indian neighbours, alike
in harmony, and peace, and love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>We have been led to reflections of this sort
by a view of girls portioned here at Rome once
a year, some for marriage and others for a
nunnery; the last set were handsomest and
fewest, and the people I converse with say that
every day makes almost visible diminution in
the number of monks and nuns. I know not,
however, whether Italy will go on much the
better for having so few convents; some
should surely be left, nay some <em>must</em> be left in
a country where it is not possible for every
man to obtain a decent livelihood by labour
as in England: no army, no navy, very little
commerce possible to the inland states, and
very little need of it in any; little study of the
law too, where the prince or baron’s lips pronounce
on the decision of property; what
must people do where so few professions are
open? Can they <em>all</em> be physicians, priests, or
shopkeepers, where little physic is taken, and
few goods bought? There are already more
clergy than can live, and I saw an <i lang="it">abate</i> with
the <i lang="fr">petit collet</i> at Lucca, playing in the orchestra
at the opera for eighteen pence pay. Let us
be all contented with the benefits received from
heaven, and let us learn better than to set up
<em>self</em>, whether nation or individual, as a standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to which all others must be reduced; while
imitation is at last but meanness, and each
may in his own sphere serve God and love
his neighbours, while variety renders life more
pleasing. <i lang="la">Quod sis esse velis</i><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, is an admirable
maxim, and surely no self-denial is necessary to
its practice; while God has kindly given to
Italians a bright sky, a penetrating intellect, a
genius for the polite and liberal arts, and a soil
which produces literally, as well as figuratively,
almost spontaneous fruits. He has bestowed
on Englishmen a mild and wholesome
climate, a spirit of application and improvement,
a judicious manner of thinking to
increase, and commerce to procure, those few
comforts their own island fails to produce.
The mind of an Italian is commonly like
his country, extensive, warm, and beautiful
from the irregular diversification of its ideas;
an ardent character, a glowing landscape.
That of an Englishman is cultivated, rich, and
regularly disposed; a steady character, a delicious
landscape.</p>

<p>I must not quit Rome however without a
word of Angelica Kauffman, who, though
neither English nor Italian, has contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
charm both nations, and shew her superior
talents both here and there. Beside her paintings,
of which the world has been the judge,
her conversation attracts all people of taste to
her house, which none can bear to leave without
difficulty and regret. But a sight of the
Santa Croce palace, with its disgusting <em>Job</em>,
and the man in armour so visibly horror-striken,
puts all painters but Salvator Rosa for
a while out of one’s head. This master’s works
are not frequent, though he painted with facility.
I suppose he is difficult to imitate or
copy, so what we have of him is <em>original</em>.
There are too many living objects here in
Job’s condition, not to render walking in the
streets extremely disagreeable; and though we
are told there are seventeen markets in Rome,
I can find none, the <i lang="la">forum boarium</i> being kept
alike in all parts of the city for ought I see;
butchers standing at their shop doors, which
are not shut nor the shop cleaned even on
Sundays, while blood is suffered to run along
the kennels in a manner very shocking to
humanity. Mr. Greatheed made me remark
that the knife they use now, is the same employed
by the old Romans in cutting up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sacrificed victim; and there are in fact ancient
figures in many bas-reliefs of this town, which
represent the inferior officers, or <i lang="la">popæ</i>, with a
priest’s albe reaching from their arms and
tucked up tight, with the sacrificing knife fastened
to it, exactly as the modern butcher
wears his dress. The apron was called <i lang="la">limus</i>,
and there was a purple welt sewed on it in
such a manner as to represent a serpent:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which Servius explains at length, but gives no
reason for the serpentine form, by some people
exalted, particularly Mr. Hogarth, as nearly
allied to the perfection of all possible grace.
This looks hypothetical, but when the map of
both hemispheres displayed before one, shews
that the Sun’s path forms the same line, called
by pre-eminence Ecliptic, we will pardon their
predilection in its favour.</p>

<p>But it is time to take leave of this <i lang="la">Roma
triumphans</i>, as she is represented in one statue
with a weeping province at her foot, <em>so</em> beautiful!
it reminded me of Queen Eleanor and fair
Rosamond. The Viaggiana sent me to look
for many things I should not have found without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that instructive guide, particularly the singular
inscription on Gaudentius the actor’s
tomb, importing that Vespasian rewarded him
with death, but that <em>Kristus</em>, for so Christ is
spelt, will reward him with a finer theatre in
heaven. He was one of our early martyrs
it appears, and an altar to <em>him</em> would surely
be now more judiciously placed at a play-house
door than one to good St. Anthony,
under whose protection the theatre at Naples
is built; with no great propriety it must
be confessed, when that Saint, disgusted by
the levities of life, retired to finish his existence,
far from the haunts of man, among the
horrors of an unfrequented desert. So has it
chanced however, that by many sects of
Christians, the player and his profession have
been severely reprobated; Calvinists forbid
them their walls as destructive to morality,
while Romanists, considering them as justly
excommunicated, refuse them the common
rites of sepulture. Scripture affords no ground
for such severity. Dr. Johnson once told me
that St. Paul quoted in his epistles a comedy
of Menander; and I got the librarian at Venice
to shew me the passage marked as a quotation
in one of the old editions: it is then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a fair inference enough that the apostle could
never have prohibited to his followers the
sight of plays, when he cited them himself;
they were indeed more innocent than any
other show of the days he lived in, and if well
managed may be always made subservient to
the great causes of religion and virtue. The
passage cited was this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Evil communication corrupts good manners.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And now with regard to the present state
of morals at Rome, one must not judge from
staring stories told one; it is like Heliogabalus’s
method of computing the number of his
citizens from the weight of their cobwebs. It
is wonderful to me the people are no worse,
where no methods are taken to keep them
from being bad.</p>

<p>As to the society, I speak not from myself,
for I saw nothing of it; some English liked
it, but more complained. Wanting amusement,
however, can be no complaint, even
without society, in a city so pregnant with
wonders, so productive of reflections; and if
the Roman nobles are haughty, who can wonder;
when one sees doors of agate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
chimney-pieces of amethyst, one can scarcely be surprised
at the possessors pride, should they in
contempt turn their backs upon a foreigner,
whom they are early taught to consider as the
Turks consider women, creatures formed for
their <em>use</em> only, or at best <em>amusement</em>, and devoted
to certain destruction at the hour of
death. With such principles, the hatred and
scorn they naturally feel for a protestant will
easily swell into superciliousness, or burst out
into arrogance, the moment it is unrestrained
by the necessity of forms among the rich, and
the desire of pillage in the poor.</p>

<p>But I shall be glad <em>now</em> to exchange lapis
lazuli for violets, and verd antique for green
fields. Here are more amethysts about Rome
than lilacs; and the laburnum which at this
gay season adorns the environs of London, I
look for in vain about the Porta del Popolo.
The proud purple tulip which decorates the
ground hereabouts, opposed to the British
harebell, is <em>Italy</em> and <em>England</em> again; but the
<em>harebell</em> by cultivation becomes a <em>hyacinth</em>, the
<em>tulip</em> remains where it began. We are now
at the 16th of April, yet I know not how or
why it is, although the oaks, young, small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and straggling as they are, have the leaves come
out all broad and full already, though the fig is
bursting out every day and hour, and the mulberry
tree, so tardy in our climate, that I have
often been unable to see scarcely a bud upon
them even in May, is here completely furnished.
Apple trees are yet in blossom round this
city, and the few elms that can be found, are
but just unfolding. Common shrubs continue
their wintry appearance, and in the general
look of spring little is gained. The hedges
now of Kent and Surrey are filled with fragrance
I am sure, and primroses in the remoter
provinces torment the sportsmen with spoiling
the drag on a soft scenting morning; while
limes, horse-chesnuts, &amp;c. contribute to produce
an effect not so inferior to that fostered
by Italian sunshine, as I expected to find it.</p>

<p>Why the first breath of far-distant summer
should thus affect the oak and fig, yet leave
the elm and apple as with us, the botanists
must tell; few advances have been made in
vegetation since we left Naples, that is certain;
the hedges were as forward near Pozzuoli two
full months ago. And here are no China
oranges to be bought; no, nor a cherry or
strawberry to be seen, while every man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
fashion’s table in London is covered with
them; and all the shops of Covent-garden and
St. James’s-street hang out their luxurious
temptations of fruit, to prove the proximity of
summer, and the advantages of industrious
cultivation. Our eating pleased me more at
every town than this; where however a man
might live very well I believe for sixpence a-day,
and lodge for twenty pounds a-year; and whoever
has no attachment to religion, friends, or
country, no prejudices to plague his neighbours
with, and no dislike to take the world
as it goes, for six or seven years of his life,
may spend them profitably at Rome, if either
his business or his pleasure be made out of the
works of art; as an income of two, or indeed
one hundred pounds <i lang="la">per annum</i>, will purchase
a man more refined delights of that kind here,
than as many thousands in England: nor need
he want society at the first houses, palaces one
ought to call them, as Italians measure no
man’s merit by the weight of his purse; they
know how to reverence even poverty, and
soften all its sorrows with an appearance of
respect, when they find it unfortunately connected
with noble birth. His own country
folk’s neglect, as they pass through, would indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
be likely enough to disturb his felicity,
and lessen the kindness of his Roman friends,
who having no idea of a person’s being shunned
for <em>any</em> other <em>possible reason</em> except the
want of a pedigree, would conclude that <em>his</em>
must be essentially deficient, and lament
their having laid out so many caresses on an
impostor.</p>

<p>The air of this city is unwholesome to foreigners,
but if they pass the first year, the
remainder goes well enough; many English
seem very healthy, who are established here
without even the smallest intention of returning
home to Great Britain, for which place we
are setting out to-morrow, 19th April 1786, and
quit a town that still retains so many just pretences
to be styled the first among the cities of the
earth; to which almost as many strangers are now
attracted by curiosity, as were dragged thither
by violence in the first stage of its dominion,
impelled by superstitious zeal in the second.
The rage for antiquities now seems to have
spread its contagion of connoisseurship over
all those people whose predecessors tore down,
levelled, and destroyed, or buried under ground
their statues, pictures, every work of art;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Poles, Russians, Swedes, and Germans innumerable,
flock daily hither in this age, to admire
with rapture the remains of those very
fabrics which their own barbarous ancestors
pulled down ten centuries ago; and give for
the head of a <em>Livia</em>, a <em>Probus</em>, or <em>Gallienus</em>,
what emperors and queens could not then use
with any efficacy, for the preservation of their
own persons, now grown sacred by rust, and
valuable from their difficulty to be decyphered.
The English were wont to be the only travellers
of Europe, the only dupes too in this way;
but desire of distinction is diffused among
all the northern nations, and our Romans
here have it more in their power, with
that prudence to assist them which it is said
they do not want, if not to <em>conquer</em> their neighbours
once again, at least to <em>ruin</em> them, by
dint of digging up their dead heroes, and calling
in the assistance of their old Pagan deities,
<em>now</em> useful to them in a <em>new</em> manner, and ever
propitious to this city, although</p>

<h2>FROM ROME TO ANCONA.</h2>

<p>In our road hither we passed through what
remains of Veia, once so esteemed and liked
by the Romans, that they had a good mind,
after they had driven Brennus back, to change
the seat of empire and remove it there; but a
belief in augury prevented it, and that event
was put off till Constantine, seduced by beauties
of situation, made the fatal change, and broke
the last thread which had so long bound tight
together the fasces of Roman sway. We did
not taste the <i lang="la">Vinum Veientanum</i> mentioned
by Martial and Horace, but trotted on to Civita
Castellana, where Camillus rejected the
base offer of the schoolmaster of Fescennium;
a good picture of his well-judged punishment
is still preserved in the Capitol.</p>

<p>The first night of our journey was spent at
Otricoli, where I heard the cuckoo sing in a
shriller sharper note than he does in England.
I had never listened to him before since I left
my own country, and his song alone would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
have convinced me I was no longer in it.
Porta di Fuga at Spoleta gates, commemorating
poor Hannibal’s precipitate retreat after the
battle of Thrasymene, may perhaps detain us
a while upon this Flaminian way; it was not
Titus Flaminius though, whose negotiations
ruined Hannibal for ever, that gave name to the
road, but Caius of the same family; they had
been Flamens formerly, and were therefore
called Flaminius, when drawn up by accident
or merit into notice; the same custom still
obtains with us: we have <em>Dr. Priestley</em> and <em>Mr.
Parsons</em>.</p>

<p>Narni Bridge cost us some trouble in clambering,
and more in disputing whether it was
originally an aqueduct or a bridge&mdash;or both.
It is a magnificent structure, irregularly built,
the arches of majestic height, but all unequal.
There was water enough under it when I was
there to take off the impropriety apparent to
many of turning so large an arch over so small
a stream. Yet notwithstanding that the river
was much swelled by long continuance of
the violent rains which lately so overflowed the
city of Rome, assisted by the Tyber, that people
went about the streets in boats, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the snows tumbled down from the
surrounding mountains, must have much increased
the quantity, and lowered the colour
of the river:&mdash;We found it even <em>now</em> yellow
with brimstone, and well deserving the epithet
of <em>sulphureous Nar</em>.</p>

<p>The next day’s drive carried us forward to
Terni, where a severe concussion of the earth
suffered only three nights since, kept all the
little town in terrible alarm; the houses were
deserted, the churches crowded, supplications
and processions in every street, and people
singing all night to the Virgin under our window.</p>

<p>Well! the next morning we hired horses
for our gentlemen; a little cart, not inconvenient
at all, for my maid and me; and
scrambled over many rocks to view the far-famed
waterfall, through a sweet country, pleasingly
intersected with hedges and planted
with vines; the ground finely undulated,
and rising by gradations of hill till the eye
loses itself among the lofty Appenines; surly
as they seem, and one would think impervious;
but against human art and human
ambition, the boundary of rocks and roaring
seas lift their proud heads in vain. Man renders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
them subservient to his imperial will, and
forces them to facilitate, not impede his dominion;
while ocean’s self supports his ships,
and the mountain yields marble to decorate
his palace.</p>

<p>This is however no moment and no place to
begin a panegyric upon the power of man,
and of his skill to subjugate the works of nature,
where the people are trembling at its
past, and dreading its future effects.</p>

<p>The cascade we came to see is formed by
the fall of a whole river, which here abruptly
drops into the Nar, from a height so prodigious,
and by a course so unbroken, that it is difficult
to communicate, so as to receive the idea:
for no eye can measure the depth of the precipice,
such is the tossing up of foam from its
bottom; and the terrible noise heard long before
one arrives so stunned and confounded
all my wits at once, that many minutes
passed before I observed the horror in our conductors,
who coming with us, then first perceived
how the late earthquake had twisted
the torrent out of its proper channel, and
thrown it down another neighbouring rock,
leaving the original bed black and deserted,
as a dismal proof of the concussion’s force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>One of our English friends who had visited
Schaffhausen, made no difficulty to prefer
this wonderful cascade to the fall of the Rhine
at that place; and what with the fissures made
in the ground by recent earthquakes, the sight
of propt-up cottages which fright the fancy
more than those already fallen, and the roar
of dashing waters driven from their destined
currents by what the people here emphatically
term palpitations of the earth; one feels a
thousand sensations of sublimity unexcited by
less accidents, and soon obliterated by real
danger.</p>

<p>Why the inhabitants will have this tumbling
river be <em>Topino</em>, I know not; but no
suggestions of mine could make them name it
Velino, as our travellers uniformly call it:
for, say they, <i lang="it">quello è il nome del sorgente</i><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; and
in fact Virgil’s line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="la">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sulfureâ Nar, albus acqua fontesque Velini,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">says no more.</p>

<p>The mountains after Terni grow steep and
difficult; no one who wishes to see the Appenines
in perfection must miss this road, yet
are they not comparable to the Alps at best,
which being more lofty, more craggy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
almost universally terminating in points of
granite devoid of horizontal strata, give one
a more majestic idea of their original and duration.
Spoleto is on the top of one of them,
and Porta della Fuga meets one at its gates.
Here as our coach broke (and who can wonder?)
we have time to talk over old stories, and
<em>look for streams immortaliz’d in song</em>: for being
tied together only with ropes, we cannot hurry
through a country most delightful of all others
to be detained in.</p>

<p>The little temple to the river god Clitumnus
afforded matter of discussion amongst our party,
whether this was, or was not the very one
mentioned by Pliny: <i lang="la">Adjacet templum priscum
et religiosum. Stat Clitumnus ipse amictus ornatusque</i><a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Greatheed was angry with me for admiring
spiral columns, as he said pillars were
always meant to support something, and spiral
lines betrayed weakness. Mr. Chappelow
quoted every classic author that had ever mentioned
the white cattle; and I said that so far
as they were whiter than other beasts of the
same kind, so far were they worse; for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
whiteness in the works of nature shewed feebleness
still more than spirals in the works of
art perhaps. So chatting on&mdash;but on no Flaminian
way, we arrived at Foligno; where
the people told us that it was the quality of
those waters to turn the clothing of many
animals white, and accordingly all the fowls
looked like those of <em>Darking</em>. I had however
no taste of their beauty, recollecting that when
I kept poultry, some accident poisoned me
a very beautiful black hen, the breed of Lord
Mansfield at Caen Wood: she recovered her
illness; but at the next moulting season, her
feathers came as white as the swans. “Let
us look,” says Mr. Sh&mdash;&mdash;, “if all the women
here have got grey hair.”</p>

<p>Tolentino and Macerata we will not speak
about, while Loretto courts description, and the
richest treasures of Europe stand in the most
delicious district of it. The number of beggars
offended me, because I hold it next to impossibility
that they should want in a country so
luxuriantly abundant; and their prostrations
as they kneel and kiss the ground before you,
are more calculated to produce disgust from
British travellers, than compassion. Nor can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I think these vagabonds distressed in earnest at
<em>this</em> time above all others; when their sovereign
provides them with employment on the
beautiful new road he is making, and insists
on their being well paid, who are found
willing to work. But the town itself of Loretto
claims my attention; so clear are its
streets, so numerous and cheerful and industrious
are its inhabitants: one would think
they had resolved to rob passengers of the trite
remark which the sight of dead wealth always
inspires, <em>that the money might be better bestowed
upon the living poor</em>. For here are very few
poor families, and fewer idlers than one expects
to see in a place where not business but
devotion is the leading characteristic. So
quiet too and inoffensive are the folks here,
that scarcely any robberies or murders, or any
but very petty infringements of the law, are
ever committed among them. Yet people
grieve to see that wealth collected, which once
diffused would certainly make many happy;
and those treasures lying dead, which well dispersed
might keep thousands alive. This observation,
not always made perhaps by those
who feel it most, or that would soonest give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
their share of it away, if once possessed, is now,
from being so often repeated, become neither
<em>bright</em> nor <em>new</em>. We will not however be petulantly
hasty to censure those who first began
the lamentation, remembering that our blessed
Saviour’s earliest disciples, and those most immediately
about him too, could not forbear
grudging to see precious ointment poured upon
his feet, whom they themselves confessed to
be the Son of God. We should likewise recollect
his mild but grave reproof of those men
who gave so decided a preference to the poor
over his sacred person, so soon to be sacrificed
<em>for them</em>, and his testimony to the woman’s
earnest love and zeal expressed by giving
him the finest thing she had. Such acceptance
as she met with, I suppose prompted
the hopes of many who have been distinguished
by their rich presents to Loretto; and let
not those at least mock or molest them, who
have been doing nothing better with their
money. Upon examination of the jewels it
is curious to observe that the intrinsic value
of the presents is manifestly greater, the more
ancient they are; but taste succeeds to solidity
in every thing, and proofs of that position may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
be found every step one treads. The vestments,
all embroidered over with picked pearl, are
quite beyond my powers of estimation.
The gold baby given at the birth of Louis Quatorze,
of size and weight equal to the real infant,
has had its value often computed; I forget
the sum though. A rock of emeralds in
their native bed presented by the Queen of
Portugal, though of Occidental growth, is
surely inestimable; and our sanguinary Mary’s
heart of rubies is highly esteemed. I asked
if Charles the Ninth of France had sent
any thing; for I thought <em>their</em> presents should
have been placed together: far, far even from
the wooden image of <em>her</em> who was a model
of meekness, and carried in her spotless bosom
the Prince of Peace. Many very exquisite
pieces of art too have found their way into
the Virgin’s cabinet; the pearl however is the
striking rarity, as it exhibits in the manner
of a blot on marble, the figure of our blessed
Saviour sitting on a cloud clasped in his mother’s
arms. Princess Borghese sent an elegantly-set
diamond necklace no longer ago
than last Christmas-day; it is valued at a
thousand pounds sterling English: but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
riches of that family appear to me inexhaustible.
Whoever sees it will say, she might have
spent the money better; but let them reflect
that one may say that of <em>all</em> expence almost;
and it is not from the state of Loretto these
treasures are taken at last: they <em>bring</em> money
there; and if any person has a right to complain,
it must be the subjects of distant
princes, who yet would scarcely have divided
among <em>them</em> the sapphires, &amp;c. they have sent
in presents to Loretto.</p>

<p>It was curious to see the devotees drag themselves
round the holy house upon their knees;
but the Santa Scala at Rome had shewn me
the same operation performed with more difficulty;
and a written injunction at bottom,
less agreeable for Italians to comply with, than
any possible prostration; viz. That no one
should spit as he went up or down, except in
his pocket-handkerchief. The lamps which
burn night and day before the black image
here at Loretto are of solid gold, and there
is such a crowd of them I scarcely could see the
figure for my own part; and that one may
see still less, the attendant canons throw a
veil over one’s face going in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The confessionals, where all may be heard
in their own language, is not peculiar to this
church; I met with it somewhere else, but
have forgotten where, though I much esteemed
the establishment. It is very entertaining
here too, to see inscriptions in twelve different
tongues, giving an account of the miraculous
removal and arrival here of the <i lang="it">Santa Casa</i>:
I was delighted with the Welch one; and our
conductor said there came not unfrequently
pilgrims from the vale of Llwydd, who in
their turns told the wonders of their <em>holy well</em>.
In Latin then, and Greek, and Hebrew,
Syriac, Phœnician, Arabic, French, Spanish,
German, Welch, and Tuscan, may you read
a story, once believed of equal credit, and
more revered I fear, than even the sacred
words of God speaking by the scriptures;
but which is now certainly upon the wane.
I told a learned ecclesiastic at Rome, that we
should return home by the way of Loretto:&mdash;“There
is no need,” said he, “to caution a
native of your island against credulity; but
pray do not believe that we are ourselves
satisfied with the tale you will read there; no
man of learning but knows, that Adrian destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
every trace and vestige of Christianity
that he could find in the East; and he was
acute, and diligent, and powerful. The empress
Helena long after him, with piety that
equalled even his profaneness, could never
hear of this holy house; how then should it
have waited till so many long years after Jesus
Christ? Truth is, Pope Boniface the VIIIth,
who canonized St. Louis, who instituted the
jubilee, who quarrelled with Philippe le Bel
about a new crusade, and who at last fretted
himself to death, though he had conquered
all his enemies, because he feared some loss
of power to the church;&mdash;desired to give
mankind a new object of attention, and encouraged
an old visionary, in the year 1296,
to propagate the tale he half-believed himself;
how the blessed Virgin had appeared to him,
and related the story you will read upon the
walls, which was then first committed to
paper. In consequence of this intelligence,
Boniface sent men into the East that he could
best depend upon, and they brought back
just such particulars as would best please the
Pope; and in those days you can scarce think
how quick the blaze of superstition caught and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
communicated itself: no one wished to deny
what his neighbour was willing to believe,
and what he himself would then have gained
no credit by contradicting. Positive evidence
of what the house really was, or whence it came,
it was in a few years impossible to obtain;
nor did Boniface the VIIIth know it himself
I suppose, much less the old visionary who
first set the matter a-going. Meantime the
house itself has <em>no foundation</em>, whatever the
story may have; it is a very singular house as
you may see; it has been venerated by the
best and wisest among Christians now for five
hundred years: even the Turks (who have
the same method of honouring their Prophet
with gifts, as we do the Virgin Mary) respect
the very name of Loretto:&mdash;why then should
the place be to any order of thinking beings a
just object of insult or mockery?”&mdash;Here
he ended his discourse, the recollection of
which never left me whilst we remained at
the place.</p>

<p>What Dr. Moore says of the singing chaplains
with <i lang="it">soprano</i> voices, who say mass at the
altars of Loretto, is true enough, and may
perhaps have been originally borrowed from
the Pagan celebration of the rites of Cybele.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
When Christianity was young, and weak, and
tender, and unsupported by erudition, dreadful
mistakes and errors easily crept in: the heathen
converts hearing much of <cite>Mater Dei</cite>, confounded
her idea with that of their <cite>Mater Deorum</cite>;
and we were shewn, among the rarities
of Rome, a <em>bronze Madonna</em>, with a tower
on her head, exactly as Cybele is represented.</p>

<p>That the jewels are taken out of this treasury
and replaced with false stones, is a speech
always said over fine things by the vulgar:
I have heard the same thing affirmed of the
diamonds at St. Denis; and can recollect the
common people saying, when our King of
England was crowned, that all the real precious
stones were locked up, or sold for state
expences; while the jewels shewn to <em>them</em>
were only calculated to dazzle for the day.
As there is always infinite falsehood in the
world, so there is always wonderful care,
however ill applied, to avoid being duped;
a terror which hangs heavily over weak minds
in particular, and frights them as far from
truth on the one side, as credulity tempts
them away from it on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>But we must visit the apothecary’s pots,
painted by Raphael, and leave Loretto, to proceed
along the side of this lovely sea, hearing the
pilgrims sing most sweetly as they go along in
troops towards the town, with now and then a
female voice peculiarly distinguished from the
rest: by this means a new image is presented to
one’s mind; the sight of such figures too half
alarm the fancy, and give an air of distance
from England, which nothing has hitherto
inspired half so strongly. This charming
Adriatic gulph beside, though more than delicious
to drive by, does not, like the Mediterranean,
convey homeish or familiar ideas;
one feels that it belongs exclusively to Venice;
one knows that ancient Greece is on the
opposite shore, and that with a quick sail one
should soon see Macedonia; and descending
but a little to the southward, visit Athens,
Corinth, Sparta, Thebes&mdash;seats of philosophy,
freedom, virtue; whence models of excellence
and patterns of perfection have been drawn
for twenty succeeding centuries!</p>

<p>Here are plenty of nightingales, but they
do not sing as well as in Hertfordshire: birds
gain in colour as you approach the tropic, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
they lose in song; under the torrid zone I
have heard they never sing at all; with us in
England the latest leave off by midsummer,
when the work of incubation goes forward,
and the parental duties begin: the nightingale
too chuses the coolest hour; and though I
have yet heard her in Italy only early in the
mornings, Virgil knew she sung in the night:</p>

<p class="noindent">To hear birds it is however indispensably
necessary that there should be high trees; and

growth can I find. The <i lang="it">roccolo</i> too, and other
methods taken to catch small birds, which
many delight in eating, and more in taking,
lessen the quantity of natural music vexatiously
enough; while gaudy insects ill supply
their place, and sharpen their stings at
pleasure when deprived of their greatest enemies.
We are here less tormented than usual
however, while the prospects are varied so
that every look produces a new and beautiful

<p>Ancona is a town perfectly agreeable to
strangers, from the good humour with which
every nation is received, and every religion
patiently endured: something of all this the
scholars say may be found in the derivation of
its name, which being Greek I have nothing
to do with. Pliny tells us its original, and
says;</p>

<p>That Dalmatia should be opposite, yet to

<p class="noindent">The fine turbots did not any of them fall to
our share; but here are good fish, and, to say
true, every thing eatable as much in perfection
as possible: I could never since I arrived
at Turin find real cause of complaint&mdash;<em>serious</em>
complaint I mean except at that savage-looking
place called Radicofani; and
some other petty town in Tuscany, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Sienna, where I eat too many eggs and
grapes, because there was nothing else.</p>

<p>Nice accommodations must not be looked
for, and need not be regretted, where so much
amusement during the day gives one good
disposition to sleep sound at night: the worst
is, men and women, servants and masters,
must often mess together; but if one frets
about such things, it is better stay at home.
The Italians like travelling in England no
better than the English do travelling in Italy;
whilst an exorbitant expence is incurred by
the journey, not well repaid to them by the
waiters white chitterlins, tambour waistcoats,
and independent “<em>No, Sir</em>,” echoed round a
well-furnished inn or tavern; which puts
them but in the place of Socrates at the fair,
who cried out&mdash;“<em>How many things have these
people gathered together that I do not want!</em>”&mdash;A
noble Florentine complained exceedingly to
me once of the English hotels, where he
was made to help pay for those good gold
watches the fellows who attended him drew
from their pockets; so he set up his quarters
comically enough at the waggoners full Moon
upon the old bridge at Bath, to be quit of the
<i lang="it">schiavitù</i>, as he called it, of living like a gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
“where,” says he, “I am not known
to be one.” The truth is, a continental nobleman
can have little heart of a country,
where, to be treated as a man of fashion, he
must absolutely behave as such: his rank is
ascertained at <em>home</em>, and people’s deportment
to him regulated by long-established customs;
nor can it be supposed flattering to its prejudices,
to feel himself jostled in the street, or
driven against upon the road by a rich trader,
while he is contriving the cheapest method of
going to look over his manufactory. Wealth
diffused makes all men comfortable, and leaves
no man splendid; gives every body two
dishes, but nobody two hundred. Objects of
show are therefore unfrequent in England,
and a foreigner who travels through our
country in search of positive sights, will, after
much money spent, go home but poorly
entertained:&mdash;“There is neither <i lang="it">quaresima</i>,”
will he say, “nor <i lang="it">carnovale</i> in <em>any</em> sense of
the word, among those insipid islanders.”&mdash;For
he who does not love our government,
and taste our manners which result from it,
can never be delighted in England; while
the inhabitants of our nation may always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
amused in theirs, without any esteem of it
at all.</p>

<p>I know not how Ancona produced all these
tedious reflexions: it is a trading place, and
a sea-port town. Men working in chains
upon the new mole did not please me though,
and their insensibility shocks one:&mdash;“Give a
poor thief something, master,” says one impudent
fellow;&mdash;“<i lang="it">Son stato ladro padrone</i><a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>;”&mdash;with
a grin. That such people should be
corrupt or coarse however is no wonder;
what surprised me most was, that when one
of our company spoke of his conduct to a
man of the town&mdash;“Why, what would you
have, Sir?”&mdash;replies the person applied to&mdash;“when
the poor creature is <i lang="it">castigato</i>, it is
enough sure, no need to make him be melancholy
too:”&mdash;and added with true Italian
good-nature,&mdash;“<i lang="it">Siamo tutti peccatori</i><a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.”</p>

<p>The mole is a prodigious work indeed; a
warm friend to Venice can scarce wish its
speedy conclusion, as the useful and necessary
parts of the project are already nearly accomplished,
and it would be pity to seduce more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
commerce away from Venice, which has
already lost so much.</p>

<p>The triumphal arch of Trajan, described
by every traveller, and justly admired by all;
white as his virtue, shining as his character,
and durable as his fame; fixed our eyes a
long time in admiration, and made us, while we
examined the beautiful structure, recollect his
incomparable qualities to whom it was
dedicated,&mdash;“<i lang="la">Inter Cæsares optimus</i><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,”&mdash;says one
of their old writers: nor could either column or
arch be so sure a proof that he was thought
so, as the wish breathed at the inauguration
of succeeding emperors; <i lang="la">Sis tu felicior Augusto,
melior Trajano</i><a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>If these Ancona men were not proud of
themselves, one should hate them; descended
as they are from those Syracusans liberated by
Timoleon, who freed them first from the
tyranny of Dionysius; fostered afterwards by
Trajan, as peculiarly worth <em>his</em> notice; and
patronised in succeeding times by the good
Corsini Pope, Clement XII., whose care for
them appears by the useful <i lang="it">lazaretto</i> he built,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
“to save,” said he, “our best subjects, our
subjects of Ancona.”</p>

<p>But we are hastening forward as fast as our
broken carriage will permit, to Padua, where
we shall leave it: thither to arrive, we pass
through Senegallia, built by the Gauls, and
still retaining the Gaulish name, but now
little remarkable. What struck me most was
my own crossing the <em>Rubicon</em> in my way back
to England, and our comfortable return to</p>

<h2>BOLOGNA,</h2>

<p>After admiring the high forehead and innocent
simper of Baroccio’s beauties at Pesaro,
where the best European silk now comes from;
against which the produce of Rimini vainly endeavours
to vie. That town was once an Umbrian
colony I think, and there is a fine memorial
there where <i lang="la">Diocletianus reposuit</i>, resolving
perhaps to end where Julius Cæsar had begun;
he died at Salo however in Dalmatia,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="la">

<p>Ravenna l’Antica tired more than it pleased
us; <em>Fano</em> is a populous pretty little town;
but I know no reason why it was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
dedicated to Fortune. Truth is, we are weary
of these sacred <em>fanes</em>, and long to see once
more our amiable friends at Venice and at
Milan.</p>

<p>I have missed San Marino at last, but receive
kind assurances every day that the loss
is small; being now little more than a convent
seated on a hill, which affords refuge for
robbers; and that the present Pope meditates
its destruction as a nuisance to the neighbouring
towns. There never was any coin struck
there it seems; I thought there had: but the
train of reflections excited by even a distant
view of it are curious enough as opposed to
its protectress Rome; which, founded by
robbers and banditti, ends in being the seat of
sanctity and priestly government; while San
Marino, begun by a hermit, and secluded
from all other states for the mere purposes of
purer devotion, finishes by its necessary removal
as a repository for assassins, and a refuge
for those who break the laws with violence.</p>

<p>Such is this variable and capricious world!
and so dies away my desire to examine this
political curiosity; the extinction of which
I am half sorry for. Privation is still a melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
idea, and were one to hear that the
race of wasps were extirpated, it would grieve
one.</p>

<p>Bologna affords one time for every meditation.
No inn upon the Bath road is more
elegant than the Pellegrino; and we regretted
our broken equipage the less as it drew us
slowly through so sweet a country. The
medlar blossoms adorn the hedges with their
blanche roses; the hawthorn bushes, later here
than with us, perfume them; and the roads,
little travelled, do not torment one with the
dust as in England, where it not only offends
the traveller, but takes away some beauty
from the country, by giving a brown or
whitish look to the shrubs and trees. We
shall repose here very comfortably, or at least
change our mode of being busy, which refreshes
one perhaps more than positive idleness.
“But life,” says some writer, “is a
continual fever;” and sure ours has been completely
so for these two years. A charming
lady of our country, for whom I have the
highest esteem, protests she shall be happy to
get back to London if it is only for the relief
of sitting still, and resolving to see no more
sights: exchanging fasto, fiera, and frittura,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
for a muffin, a mop, and a morning newspaper:
three things equally unknown in Italy,
as the other three among us.</p>

<p>With regard to pictures however, <i lang="fr">l’Appetit
vient en mangeant</i><a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, as I experienced completely
when traversing the Zampieri palace
with eagerness that increased at every step.
I once more half-worshipped the works of divine
Guercino. Nothing shall prevent my
going to his birth-place at Cento, whether in
our way or out of it.</p>

<p>We ran about the Specola again, and received
a thousand polite attentions from the
gentleman who shewed it. The piece of native
gold here is much finer than that we saw
among the treasures of Loretto, which being
<i lang="fr">du nouveau continent</i> is always inferior.
“But every thing does,” as Mons. de Buffon
observes, “degenerate in the West
except birds;” and the Brazilian plumage
seems to surpass all possibility of further glow.
The continent however shews us no specimens
preserved half as well as those of Sir Ashton
Lever. The marine rarities here at Bologna
are very capital; but I saw them to advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
now, in company of Mr. Chappelow. We
find this city at once hot, and loud, and pious;
less empty of occupation though than last
time; for here is a new Gonfaloniere chosen
in to-day, and the drums beat, and
the trumpets sound, and some donations
are distributed about, much in the proportions
Tom Davis describes Garrick’s to
have been; small pieces of money, and large
pieces of cake, with quantities of meat, bread,
and birds, borne about the town in procession,
to make display of <em>his</em> bounty, who gives all
this away at the time he is elected into office.
Kids dressed with ribbon therefore, alive and
carried on men’s shoulders showily adorned,
lambs washed white as snow, and pretty red
and white calves hanging their simple faces
out of fine gilt baskets, paraded the streets all
day. What struck us most however was an
ox, handsomer and of a more silvery coat
than I thought an ox’s hide capable of being
brought to; his horns gold, and a garland of
roses between them. This was beautiful; reminded
one of all one had ever read and heard
of victims going to sacrifice; and put in our
heads again the old stories of Hercules, Eurystheus,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>At Bologna though, every thing puts people
in mind of their <em>prayers</em>; so a few good
women nothing doubting but when shows
were going forward, religious meanings must
be near at hand, dropt down on their knees
in the street, and recommended themselves, or
their dead friends perhaps, to heaven, with
fervent and innocent earnestness, while the
cattle passed along. An English clergyman
in our company, hurt and grieved, yet half-disposed
to laugh, cried, <em>What are these
dear creatures muttering about now for, as if
their salvation depended upon it?</em>&mdash;It was absurd
enough to be sure; but in order to check
our tittering disposition, I recollected to him,
that I had once heard an ignorant woman in
Hertfordshire repeat the absolution herself after
the priest, with equally ill-placed fervour:
for which he reprimanded her, and afterwards
explained to her the grossness of the impropriety.
When we have added to our stock of
connoisseurship the graceful Sampson, drinking
after his victory, by Guido, in this town,
we shall quit it, and proceed through empty
and deserted Ferrara to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<h2>PADUA.</h2>

<p>We set out then for Ferrara, in our kind
friend’s post-chaise; that is, my maid and I
did: our good-natured gentlemen creeping
slowly after in the broken coach; and how
ended this project for insuring safety? Why
in the chaise losing its hind wheel, and in our
return to the carriage we had quitted. But it
is for ever so, I think;&mdash;the sick folks live always,
and the well ones die.</p>

<p>We took turn therefore and left our friends;
but could not forbear a visit to Cento, where
I wished much to see what Guercino had done
for the ornament of his native place, and was
amply repaid my pains by the sight of one
picture, which, for its immediate power over the
mind, at least over mine, has no equal even
in Palazzo Zampieri. It is a scene highly
touching. The appearance of our Saviour to
his Mother after his resurrection. The dignity,
the divinity of the Christ! the terror-checked
transport visible in the parent Saint,
whose expressive countenance and pathetic attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
display fervent adoration, maternal tenderness,
and meek humility at once! How
often have I said, <em>this</em> is the finest picture we
have seen yet! when looking on the Caraccis
and their school. I will say no more, the
painter’s art can go no further than <em>this</em>. My
partial preference of Guercino to any thing
and to every thing, shall not however bribe me
to suppress my grief and indignation at his
strange method of commemorating his own
name over the altar where he was baptised,
which shocks every protestant traveller by its
profaneness, while the Romanists admire his
invention, and applaud his piety. Guercino
then, so called because he was the <em>little one-eyed
man</em>, had a fancy to represent his <em>real</em>
appellation of <em>John Francis Barbieri</em> in the
church; and took this mode as an ingenious
one, painting St. John upon the right hand,
St. Francis on the left, as two large full-length
figures, and God the Father in the middle
with a <em>long beard</em> for <em>Barbieri</em>.</p>

<p>This is a mixture of Abel Drugger’s contrivance
in the Alchymist, and the infantine
folly of three babies I once knew in England,
children of a nobleman, who were severely
whipt by their governess for playing at Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Son, and Holy Ghost, sitting upon three
chairs, with solemn countenances, in order to
impress their tender fancies with a representation
of what the good governess innocently
and laudably had told them about the mysterious
and incomprehensible Trinity. Let
me add, that the eldest of these babies was
not six years old, and the youngest but four,
when they were caught in the blasphemous
folly. Our Italians seem to be got very little
further at forty.</p>

<p>Padua appears cleaner and prettier than it
did last year; but so many things contribute
to make me love it better, that it is no wonder
one is prejudiced in its favour. It was <em>so</em>
difficult to get safe hither, the roads being very
bad, the people were so kind when we were
here last, and the very inn-keeper and his assistants
seemed so obligingly rejoiced to see
us again, that I felt my heart quite expand at
entering the Aquila d’oro, where we were soon
rejoined by Mr. and Mrs. Greatheed, with
whom we had parted in the Romagna, when
they took the Perugia road, instead of returning
by Bologna, a place they had seen before.
Had we come three days sooner we might have
seen the transit of Mercury from Abate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Toaldo’s observatory; but our own transit took
up all our thoughts, and it is a very great
mercy that we are come safe at last. I think
it was as much as four bulls and six horses
could do to drag us into Rovigo.</p>

<p class="noindent">say the Venetians: and round this town
where the heat is indeed prodigious, they get
the best vipers for the Venice treacle, I am
told. Here are quantities of curious plants
to be seen blooming now in the botanical
garden, and our kind professor told me I need
not languish so for horse chesnuts; for they
would all be in flower as we returned up the
Brenta from Venice. “They are all in flower
<em>now</em>, Sir,” said I, “in my own grounds, eight
miles from London: but our English oaks are
not half so forward as yours are.” He recollected
the aphorism so much a favourite with our country
folks; how a British heart ought not to dilate
with the early sunshine of prosperity, or
droop at the first blasts of adverse fortune, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the British oak refuses to put out his leaves at
summer’s early felicitations, and scorns to
drop them at winter’s first rude shake.</p>

<p>Well! I have once more walked over St.
Antony’s church, and examined the bas-reliefs
that adorn his shrine; but their effect has
ceased. Whoever has spent some time in the
Musæum Clementinum is callous to the wonders
which sculpture can perform.</p>

<p>Has one not read in Ulloa’s travels, of a
resting-place on the side of a Cordillera among
the Andes, where the ascending traveller is regularly
observed to put on additional clothing,
while he who comes down the mountain
feels so hot that he throws his clothes away?
So it is with the shrine of St. Antonio di Padua,
and one’s passion for the sculpture that
adorns it: while Santa Giustina’s church regains
her power over the mind, a power never
missed by simplicity, while great effort
has often small effect. But we are hastening
to Venice, and shall leave our cares and our
coach behind; superfluous as they both are,
in a city which admits of neither.</p>

<h2>VENICE.</h2>

<p>Our watery journey was indeed delightful;
friendship, music, poetry combined their charms
with those of nature to enchant us, and make one
think the passage was too short, though longing
to embrace our much-regretted sweet
companions. The scent of odoriferous plants,
the smoothness of the water, the sweetness of
the piano forte, which allured to its banks many
of the gay inhabitants, who glad of a change
in the variety of their amusements, came
down to the shores and danced or sang, as we
went by, seized every sense at once, and filled
me with unaffected pleasure. I longed to see
the weeping willow planted along this elegant
stream; but the Venetians like to see nothing
weep I fancy: yet the Salix Babylonica would
have a fine effect here, and spread to a prodigious
growth, like those on which the captive
Israelites once hung their harps, on the
banks of the river Euphrates. “Of all Europe
however,” Millar says, “it prospers
best in pensive Britain;”</p>

much ado to think these six lines better worth
fifty pounds a piece, the price Sannazarius
was paid for them, than many lines I have
read; as mythological allusions are always
cheaply obtained, and this can hardly be said
to run with any peculiar happiness: for if
Mars built the Wall, and Jupiter founded the
Capitol, how could Neptune justly challenge
this last among all people, to look on both, and
say, That men built Rome, but the Gods
founded Venice. Had he said, that after all
their pains, <em>this</em> was the manner in which
those two cities would in future times strike
all impartial observers, it would have been
<em>enough</em>; and it would have been <em>true</em>, and
when fiction has done its best,</p>

nightingales who, when men are most silent,
answer each other across the canals, increase
the enchantments of Venetian moonlight;
while the full gondolas skimming over the
tide with a lanthorn in their stern, like glow-worms
of a dark evening, dashing the cool

unmarked by peculiarity of pleasure.
The Doge’s wedding has however been less
brilliant this year; his galleys have been sent
to fight the Turks and Corsairs, and the
splendor at home of course suffers some temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
diminution; but the corso of boats in
the evening must be for ever charming, and
the musical parties upon the water delightful.
We passed this morning in Pinelli’s library, a
collection so valuable from the frequence of
old editions, particularly the old fourteen
hundreds as we call them, that it is supposed
they will be purchased by some crowned head;
and here are specimens of Aldus’s printing too,
very curious; but there are too many curiosities,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I’m strangled with the waste fertility,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as Milton says. Pinelli had an excellent taste
for pictures likewise, and here at Venice there
are paintings to satisfy, nay satiate connoisseurship
herself. Tintoret’s force of colouring at
St. Rocque’s, displayed in the crucifixion, can
surely be exceeded by no disposition of light
and shade; but the Scuola Bolognese has hardened
my heart against merit of any other sort,
so much more easy to be obtained, than that
of character, dignity, and truth. Paul Veronese
forgets too seldom his original trade of
<i lang="it">orefice</i>, there is too much gold and silver in his
drapery; and though Darius’s ladies are judiciously
adorned with a great deal of it here
at Palazzo Pisani, I would willingly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
abated some brocade, for an addition of expressive
majesty in the Alexander. What a
striking difference there is too between Guercino’s
prodigal returned, and a picture at some
Venetian palace of the same story treated by
Leandro Bassano! yet who can forbear crying
out Nature, nature! when in the last named
work one sees the faithful spaniel run out to
meet and acknowledge his poor young master
though in rags, while the cook admiring the
uncommon fatness of the calf, seems to anticipate
the pleasure of a jolly day: so if the
old father does look a little like pantaloon,
why one forgives him, for we are not told
that the fable had to do with <i lang="it">nobiltà</i>, though
Guercino has made <em>his</em> master of the house a
rich and stately oriental, who meets and consoles,
near a column of Grecian architecture,
his penitent son, whose half-uncovered form
exhibits beauty sunk into decay, and whose
graceful expression of shame and sorrow shew
the dignity of his original birth, and little expectation
of the ill-endured pains his poverty
has caused: the elder brother, meantime,
glowing with resentment, and turning with
apparent scorn away from the sight of a scene
so little to the honour of the family. Basta!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
as the Italians say; when we were at Rome
we purchased a fine view of St. Mark’s Place
Venice; now we are at Venice we have
bought a sketch of Guido’s Aurora. The
Doge’s dinner was magnificent, the plate older
and I think finer than the Pope’s; I forget
on what occasion it was given, I mean the
feast, but had it been an annual ceremony our
kind friends would have shewn it us last year.
We must leave them once more, for a long
time I fear, but I part with less regret because
the heat grows almost insupportable; and
either the stench of the small canals, or else
the too great abundance of sardelline, a fresh
anchovy with which these seas abound, keep
me unwell and in perpetual fear of catching
a putrid fever, should I indulge in eating once
again of so rich but dangerous a dainty. Besides
that one may be tired of exertion, and
fatigued with festivity, purchased at the price
of sleep and quiet.</p>

<h2>To PADUA.</h2>

<p>Then we returned the twelfth of June, and
surely it is too difficult to describe the sweet
sensations excited by the enjoyment of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Each rural sight, each rural sound;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as the dear banks of the Brenta first saluted our
return to <i lang="la">terra firma</i> from the watery residence
of our <i lang="it">bella dominante</i>. We dined at a lovely
villa belonging to an amiable friend upon the
margin of the river, where the kind embraces
of the Padrona di Casa, added to the fragrance
of her garden, and the sweet breath of oxen
drawing in her team, revived me once more to
the enjoyment of cheerful conversation, by
restoring my natural health, and proving beyond
a possibility of doubt, that my late disorder
was of the putrid kind. We dined in a
grotto-like room, and partook the evening refreshments,
cake, ice, and lemonade, under a
tree by the river side, whilst my own feelings
reminded me of the sailors delight described
in Anson’s voyages when they landed at Juan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Fernandez. Night was best disposed of in the
barge, and I observed as we entered Padua
early in the morning, how surprisingly quick
had been the progress of summer; but in
these countries vegetation is so rapid, that
every thing makes haste to come and more to
go. Scarce have you tasted green pease or
strawberries, before they are out of season; and
if you do <em>not</em> swallow your pleasures, as Madame
la Presidente said, you have a chance to
miss of getting any pleasures at all. Here is
no mediocrity in any thing, no moderate
weather, no middle rank of life, no twilight;
whatever is not night is day, and whatever is
not love is hatred; and that the English
should eat peaches in May, and green pease
in October, sounds to Italian ears as a miracle;
they comfort themselves, however, by saying
that they <em>must</em> be very insipid, while <em>we</em> know
that fruits forced by strong fire are at least
many of them higher in flavour than those
produced by sun; the pine-apple particularly,
which West Indians confess eats better with us
than with them. Figs and cherries, however,
defy a hot-house, and grapes raised by art are
worth little except for shew; peaches, nectarines,
and ananas are the glory of a British gardener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and no country but England can shew such.
Our morning, passed at the villa of the senator
Quirini, set us on this train of thinking, for
every culled excellence adorned it, and brought
to my mind Voltaire’s description of Pococuranti
in Candide, false only in the ostentation,
and <em>there</em> the character fails; misled by a French
idea, that pleasure is nothing without the delight
of shewing that you are pleased, like the
old adage, or often-quoted passage about learning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="la">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A Venetian has no such notions; by force of
mind and dint of elegance inherent in it, he
pleases himself first, and finds every body else
delighted of course, nor would quit his own
country except for paradise; while an English
nobleman clumps his trees, and twists his river,
to comply with his neighbour’s taste, when perhaps
he has none of his own; feels disgusted
with all he has done, and runs away to live
in Italy.</p>

<p>The evening of this day was spent at the
theatre, where I was glad the audience were
no better pleased, for the plaudits of an Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Platea at an air they like, when one’s nerves
are weak and the weather very hot, are all
but totally insupportable. What then must
these poor actors have suffered, who laboured
so violently to entertain us? A tragedy in
rhyme upon the subject of Julius Sabinus and
his wife Epponina was the representation; and
wonderfully indeed did the players struggle,
and bounce, and sprunt, like vigorous patients
resisting the influence of a disease called opisthotonos,
or dry gripes of Jamaica; “Were
their jaws once locked we should do better,”
said Mr. Chappelow. “Che spacca monti
mai!” exclaimed the gentle Padovani. <i lang="it">Spacca
monte</i> means just our English Drawcansir, a
fellow that splits mountains with his bluster,
a captain <em>Blowmedown</em>.</p>

<p>The fair at Padua is a better place for
spending one’s time than the theatre; it is
built round a pretty area, and I much wonder
the middle is not filled by a band of music.
Our Astley is expected to shine here shortly,
and the ladies are in haste to see <i lang="it">il bel Inglese
a Cavallo</i>; but we must be seduced to stay no
longer among those whom I must ever leave
with grateful regret and truly affectionate
regard. Our carriage is repaired, and the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
says it will now carry us safely round the world
if we please; our first stage however will be
no farther than to pretty</p>

<hr />

<h2>VERONA.</h2>

<p>The road from Padua hither is a vile one;
one can scarcely make twenty miles a-day in
any part of the Venetian state. Its senators,
accustomed to water carriage, have little care
for us who go by land. The Palanzuola
way is worse however, and I am glad once
more to see sweet Verona.</p>

<p>Petruchio and Catharine might easily have
met with all the adventures related by Grumio
on their journey thither, but when once arrived
she should have been contented. This
city is as lovely as ever, more so than it was
last April twelvemonth, when the spring was
sullen and backward; every hill now glows
with the gay produce of summer, and every
valley smiles with plenty expected or pleasure
possessed. The antiquities however look less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
respectable than when I left them; no amphitheatre
will do after the Roman Colossæum,
and our triumphal arch here looked so pitiful,
I wondered what was come to it. So must it
always happen to the performances of art, which
we compare one against another, and find
that as man made the best of them, so some
man may in some moment make a better still:
but the productions of nature are the works
of God; we can only compare them with
other things done by the same Almighty Master,
whose power is equally discernible in all,
from the fly’s antennæ to the elephant’s proboscis.
Bozza’s collection gave birth to this
last sentence; the farther one goes the more
astonishing grows his musæum, the neglect of
which is sure no credit to the present age. I
find his cabinet much fuller than I left it, and
adorned with many new specimens from the
southern seas, besides flying-fish innumerable,
beautifully preserved, and one predaceous
creature caught in the very act of gorging his
prey, a proof of their destruction being instant
as that of the dwellers in Pompeia, who had
their dinners dished when the eruption overwhelmed
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>We took leave of our learned friends here
with concern, but hope to see them again, and
tread the stucco floors so prettily mottled and
variegated, they look like the cold mock turtle
soup exactly, which London pastry-cooks keep
in their shops, ready for immediate use.</p>

<p>What an odd thing is custom! here is weather
to fry one in, yet after exercise, and in a state
of the most violent perspiration, no consequences
follow the use of iced beverages, except
the sense of pleasure resulting from them
at the moment. Should a Bath belle indulge
in such luxury, after dancing down forty
couple at Mr. Tyson’s ball, we should expect
to hear next day of her surfeit at least, if not
of her sudden death. Lying-in ladies take
the same liberty with <em>their</em> constitutions, and
<em>say</em> that no harm comes of it; and when I tell
them how differently we manage in England,
cry, “<i lang="it">mi pare che dev’essere schiavitù grande
in quel paese della benedetta libertà</i><a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.” Fine
muslin linen nicely got up is however, say
they, one of the things to be produced only in
Great Britain, and much do our Italian ladies
admire it, though they look very charmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with much less trouble taken. I lent one lady
at some place, I remember, my maid, to shew
her, as she so much wished it, how the operation
of clear-starching was performed; but
as soon as it began, she laughed at the superfluous
fatigue, as she called it; and her servants
crossed themselves in every corner of
the room, with wonder that such niceties
should be required.&mdash;Well they might! for
I caught a great tall fellow ironing his lady’s
best neck-handkerchief with the warming-pan
here at Padua very quietly; and she was
a woman of quality too, and looked as lovely,
when the toilette was once performed, as if
much more attention had been bestowed
upon it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>PARMA.</h2>

<p>We passed through Mantua the 18th of
June, where nothing much attracted my notice,
except a female figure in the street, veiled
from head to foot, and covered wholly in
black; she walked backward and forward
along the same portion of the same street, from
one to three o’clock, in the heat of the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sun; her hand held out; but when I,
more from curiosity than any better motive
put money in it, she threw it silently away, and
the beggars picked it up, while she held her hand
again as before. This conduct, in any town of
England, would be deemed madness or mischief;
the woman would be carried before a
magistrate to give an account of herself, should
the mob forbear to uncase her till they came;
or some charitable person would seize and
carry her home, fill her pockets with money,
and coax her out of the anecdotes of her past
life to put in the Magazine; her print would
be published, and many engravers struggle
for its profits; the name at bottom, <em>Annabella,
or the Sable Matron</em>; while novels would be
written without end, and the circulating libraries
would lend them out all the live-long
day. Things are differently carried on however
at Mantua: I asked one shopkeeper, and
she gravely replied, “<i lang="it">per divozione</i>,” and took
no further notice: another (to my inquiries,
which appeared to him far odder than the woman’s
conduct) said, The lady was possibly doing
a little penance; that he had not minded her
till I spoke, but that perhaps it might be some
woman of fashion, who having refused a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
person roughly on some occasion, was condemned
by her confessor to try for a couple
of hours what begging <em>was</em>, and learn humanity
from experience of evil. The idea
charmed me; while the man coolly said, all
this was only his conjecture; but that such
things were done too often to attract attention;
and hoped such virtue was not rare
enough to excite wonder. My just applause
of such sentiments was stopt by the <i lang="fr">laquais
de place</i> calling me to dinner; when
he informed me, that he had asked about the
person whose behaviour struck me so, and
could now tell me all there was to be known;
she was a lady of quality, he said, who had
lost a dear friend on that day some years past,
and that she wore black for two hours ever
since upon its anniversary; but that she
would now change her dress, and I should
see her in the evening at the opera. My recollecting
that if <em>this</em> were her case, I ought to
have been keeping her company (as no one
ever lost a friend so dear to them as was my
incomparable mother, who likewise left me to
mourn her loss on this day thirteen years),
spoiled my appetite, and took from me all
power of meeting the lady at the theatre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>We went again however to see Virgil’s
field, and recollected that <i lang="la">tenet nunc Parthenope</i>;
congratulated the giants on their superiority
over Pietro de Cortona’s paltry
creatures, in one of the Roman palaces; and
drove forward to Parma, through bad roads
enough.</p>

<p>This Mantua is a very disagreeable town;
nor was Romeo wrong in lamenting his banishment
to it; for though I will not say with
him that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There is no world without Verona’s walls;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet it must be allowed that few places do
unite such various excellencies, and that the
contrast is very striking between that city and
this.</p>

<p>Parma exhibits an appearance somewhat
different from all the rest; yet we should
scarcely have visited it but for the sake of the
four surprising pictures it contains: the <i lang="it">Madona
della Scodella</i> is nature itself; and St.
Girolamo exhibits such a proof of fancy and
fervour, as are almost inconceivable; the general
effect, and the difficulty one has to take
one’s eye off it, afford conviction of its superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
merit, and greatly compensate for that
taste, character, and expression, which are
found only in the Caraccis and their school.
Corregio was perhaps one of the most powerful
geniusses that has appeared on earth;
destitute of knowledge, or of the means of acquiring
it, he has left glorious proofs of what
uninstructed man may do, and is perhaps a
greater honour to the human species, than
those who, from fermenting erudition of various
kinds, produce performances of more
complicated worth. The Fatal Curiosity, and
Pilgrim’s Progress, will live as long as the
Prince of Abyssinia, or <i lang="fr">Les Avantures de Telemaque</i>,
perhaps: and who shall dare say, that
Lillo, Bunyan, and Antonio Corregio, were
not <em>naturally</em> equal to Johnson, Michael Angelo,
and the Archbishop of Cambray?&mdash;Have
I said enough, or can enough be ever
said in praise of a painter, whose works the
great Annibale Caracci delighted to study, to
copy, and to praise?</p>

<p>Piacenza we found to offer us few objects
of attention: an <i lang="it">improvisatore</i>, and not a very
bad one, amused that time which would
otherwise have been passed in lamenting our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
paucity of entertainment; while his artful
praises of England put me in good humour,
spite of the weather, which is too hot to bear.
With all our lamentations about the heat
however, here is no <i lang="it">cicala</i> on the trees, or
<i lang="it">lucciola</i> in the hedges, as at Florence; the days
are a little longer too, and the crepuscule less
abrupt in its departure. How often, upon
the <i lang="it">Ponte della Trinitá</i>, have I secretly regretted
the long-drawn evenings of an English
summer; when the dewy night-fall refreshes
the air, and silent dusk brings on a
train of meditations uninspired by Italian
skies! In this decided country all that is not
broad day is dark night; all that is not loud
mirth, is penitence and grief; when the rain
falls, it falls in a torrent; when the sun shines,
it glows like a burning-glass; where the
people are rich, they stick gems in their very
walls, and make their chimneys of amethyst;
where they are poor, they clasp your knees
in an agony of pinching want, and display
diseases which cannot be a day survived!</p>

<p>Talking on about Italy in which there is no
mediocrity, and of England in which there is
nothing else, we arrived at Lodi; where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
began to rejoice in hearing the people cry
<i lang="it">no’ cor’ altr’</i> again, in reply to our commands;
because we were now once more returned
to the district and dialect of dear
Milan, where we have cool apartments and
warm friends; and where, after an absence
of fifteen months, we shall again see those
acquaintance with whom we lived much
before; a sensation always delightfully soothing,
even when one returns to less amiable
scenes, and less productive of innocent pleasure
than these have been to me. The consciousness
of having, while at a distance, seen
few people more agreeable than those one left
behind; the natural thankfulness of one’s
heart to God, for having preserved one’s life
so as to see them again, expands philanthropy;
and gives unaffected comfort in the
restored society of companions long concealed
from one by accident or distance.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2>MILAN.</h2>

<p class="right">21st June 1786.</p>

<p>After rejoicing over my house and my
friends; after asking a hundred questions,
and hearing a hundred stories of those long
left; after reciprocating common civilities,
and talking over common topics, we observed
how much the general look of Milan
was improved in these last fifteen months;
how the town was become neater, the ordinary
people smarter, the roads round their
city mended, and the beggars cleared away
from the streets. We did not find however
that the people we talked to were at all
charmed with these new advantages: their
convents demolished, their processions put an
end to, the number of their priests of course
contracted, and their church plate carried by
cart-loads to the mint; holidays forbidden,
and every saint’s name erased from the calendar,
excepting only St. Peter and St. Paul;
whilst those shopkeepers who worked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
monasteries, and those musicians who sung or
played in oratorios, are left to find employment
how they can;&mdash;cloud the countenances
of all, and justly; as such sudden and
rough reforms shock the feelings of the multitude;
offend the delicacy of the nobles;
make a general stagnation of business and of
pleasure, in a country where <em>both</em> depend upon
religious functions; and terrify the clergy
into no ill-grounded apprehensions of being
found in a few years more wholly useless, and
as such dismissed.&mdash;Well! whatever is done
hastily, can scarcely be done quite well; and
wherever much is done, a great part of it will
doubtless be done wrong. A considerable
portion of all this however will be confessed
useful, and even necessary, when the hour
of violence on one side, and prejudice on the
other, is past away; as the fire of London has
been found beneficial by those who live in the
newly-restored town. Meantime I think the
present precipitation indecent enough for my
own part; a thousand little errors would burn
out of themselves, were they suffered to die
quietly away; and when the morning breaks
in naturally, it is superfluous as awkward to
put the stars out with one’s fingers, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Hours in Guercino’s Aurora<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. Whoever therefore
will be at the pains a little to pick their
principles, not grasp them by the bunch, will
find as many unripe at one end, I believe, as
there are rotten at the other: for could we
see these hasty innovators erecting public
schools for the instruction of the poor, or
public work-houses for their employment;
did they unlock the treasure-house of true religion,
by publishing the Bible in every dialect
of their dominions, and oblige their clergy to
read it with the souls committed to their
charge;&mdash;I should have a better idea of their
sincerity and disinterested zeal for God’s
glory, than they give by tearing down his
statues, or those of his blessed Virgin Mother,
which Carlo Borromæo set up.</p>

<p>The folly of hanging churches with red
damask would surely fade away of itself;
among people of good sense and good taste;
who could not long be simple enough to suppose,
that concealing Greek architecture with
such transient finery, and giving to God’s
house the air of a tattered theatre, could in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
any wife promote his service, or their salvation.
Many superstitious and many unmeaning
ceremonies <em>do</em> die off every day, because
unsupported by reason or religion: Doctor
Carpanni, a learned lawyer, told me but to-day,
that here in Lombardy they had a custom,
no longer ago than in his father’s time,
of burying a great lord or possessor of lands,
with a ceremony of killing on his grave the
favourite horse, dog, &amp;c. that he delighted in
when alive; a usage borrowed from the Oriental
Pagans, who burn even the widows of the
deceased upon their funeral pile; and among
our monuments in Westminster Abbey, set up
in the days of darkness, I have minded now
and then the hawk and greyhound of a nobleman
lying in marble at his feet; some of our
antiquarians should tell us if they killed
them.</p>

<p>Another odd affinity strikes me. Half a
century ago there was an annual procession at
Shrewsbury, called by way of pre-eminence
<em>Shrewsbury Show</em>; when a handsome young
girl of about twelve years old rode round the
town, and wished prosperity to every trade
assembled at the fair: I forget what else
made the amusement interesting; but have
heard my mother tell of the particular beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of some wench, who was ever after called the
<em>Queen</em>, because she had been carried in triumph
as such on the day of <em>Shrewsbury Show</em>. Now
if nobody gives a better derivation of that
old custom, it may perhaps be found a dreg
of the Romish superstition, which as many
years ago, in various parts of Italy, prompted
people to dress up a pretty girl, on the 25th
of March, or other season dedicated to the
Virgin, and carry her in procession about the
streets, singing litanies to her, &amp;c. and ending,
in profaneness of admiration, a day begun
in idleness and folly. At Rome however no
such indecorous absurdities are encouraged:
we saw a beautiful figure of the <em>Madonna</em>,
dressed from a picture of Guido Rheni, borne
about one day; but no human creature in
the street offered to kneel, or gave one the
slightest reason to say or suppose that she was
worshipped: some sweet hymns were sung in
her praise, as the procession moved slowly on;
but no impropriety could I discern, who
watched with great attention.</p>

<p>It is time to have done with all this though,
and go see the Ambrosian library; which, as
far as I can judge, is perfectly respectable.
The Prefect’s politeness kindly offered my
curiosity any thing I was particularly anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to see, and the learned Mr. Dugati was exceedingly
obliging. The old Virgil preserved
here with Petrarch’s marginal notes in his
own hand-writing, interest one much; this
little narration, evidently written for his own
fancy to feed on, of the day and hour he first
felt the impression of Laura’s charms, is the
best proof of his genuine passion for that lady,
as he certainly never meant for our inspection
what he wrote down in his own Virgil.
Here is likewise the valuable MS. of Flavius
Josephus the Jewish historian, a curiosity deservedly
admired and esteemed: it is kept
with peculiar care I think, and is in high
preservation: A Syriac bible too, very fine
indeed, from which I understand they are
now going to print off some copies. I have
been taught by the scholars not to think a
Syriac bible of the Samaritan text so very
rare; but the Septuagint in that language is so
exceedingly scarce, that many are persuaded
this is the only one extant; and as our Lord,
in his quotations from the old law, usually
cites that version, it is justly preferred to all
others. Leonardo da Vinci’s famous folio
preserved in this library, for which James I.
of England offered three thousand ducats, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
event recorded here over the chest that contains
it on a tablet of marble, deserves attention
and reverence: nothing seems above,
nothing below, the observation of that prodigious
genius. He has in this, and other volumes
of the same curious work, apparently put down
every painter’s or mathematician’s thought that
crossed his imagination. It is a <em>Leonardiana</em><a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>,
the common-place book of a great and wise
man; nor did our British sovereign ever with
more good sense evince his true love of learning,
than by his princely offer of its purchase.</p>

<p>Till now the looking at friends, and
rarities, and telling old stories, and seeing
new sights, &amp;c. has lulled my conscience
asleep, nor suffered me to recollect that,
dazzled by the brightness of the Corregios at
Parma, the account of their press, the finest
in Europe, and infinitely superior to our
Baskerville, escaped me. They have a glorious
collection too of bibles in their library;
their illuminations are most delicate, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
bindings pompous, but they possess a modern
MS. of such singular perfection, that none of
those finished when chirography was more
cultivated than it is now, can at all pretend to
compare with it. The characters are all gilt,
the leaves vellum, the miniatures finished
with a degree of nicety rarely found in union,
as here, with the utmost elegance and taste.
No words I can use will give a just idea of
this little MS.: whoever is a true fancier of
such things, would find his trouble well repaid,
if he left London only to look at it. The book
contains private devotions for the duchess with
suitable ornaments&mdash;I will talk no more of it.</p>

<p>The fine colossal figure of the Virgin
Mary in heaven crowned by her Son’s
hand, painted in the cieling of some church
at Parma, has a bad light, and it is difficult
to comprehend its sublimity. One approaches
nearer to understand the merits of
that singular performance when one looks at
Caracci’s copy of it, kept in the Ambrosian
library here at Milan. But how was I surprised
to hear related as a fact happening to
<em>him</em>, the old story told to all who go to see
St. Paul’s cathedral in London, of our Sir
James Thornhill, who, while he was intent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
on painting the cupola, walked backward to
look at the effect, till, arriving at the very
edge of the scaffold, he was in danger of dashing
his brains out by falling from that horrible
height upon the marble below, had not
some bystander possessed readiness of mind to
run suddenly forward, and throw a pencil
daubed in white stuff which stood near him,
at the figure Sir James’s eyes were fixed on,
which provoked the painter to follow him
threatening, and so saved his life. Could
such an accident have happened twice? and
is it likely that to either of these persons it
ever happened at all? Would such men as
Annibal Caracci and Sir James Thornhill
have exposed themselves upon an undefended
scaffold, without railing it round to prevent
their tumbling down, when engaged in a
work that would take them many days, nay
weeks, to finish it? Impossible! in every
nation traditionary tales shake my belief exceedingly;
and what astonishes one more
than it disgusts, if possible, is to see the same
story fitted to more nations than one.</p>

<p>It is now many years since a counsellor related
at my house in Surrey the following narration,
of which I had then no doubts, or idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of suspicion; for he said he was himself witness
to the fact, and laid the scene at St. Edmondsbury,
a town in our county of Suffolk:
how a man accused of murder, with every
corroborating circumstance, escaped by the
steady resolution of one juryman, who could
not, by any arguments or remonstrances of
his companions, be prevailed on to pronounce
the fellow guilty, though every possible circumstance
combined to ascertain him as the
person who took the deceased’s life; and how,
after all was over, the juryman confessed privately
to the judge, that <em>he himself</em>, by such
and such an accident, had killed the farmer,
of whose death the other stood accused.
This event, true or false, of which I have
since found the rudiments in a French Recueil,
was told me at Venice by a gentleman as
having happened <em>there</em>, under the immediate
inspection of a friend he named. Quere,
whether any such thing ever happened at all
in any time or place? but laxity of narration,
and contempt of all exactness, at
last extinguish one’s best-founded confidence
in the lips of mortal man. It is, however,
clearly proved, that no duty is so difficult
as to preserve truth in all our transactions,
while no transaction is so trifling as to preclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
temptation of infringing it: for if there
is no interest that prompts a liar, his vanity
suffices; nor will we mention the suggestions
of cowardice, malignity, or any species of
vice, when, as in these last-mentioned stories,
many fictions are invented by well-meaning
people, who hope to prevent mischief, inculcate
the possibility of hanging innocence, &amp;c.
and violate truth out of regard to virtue.</p>

<p>Well, well! our good Italians here will not
condescend to live or lie, if now and then they
scruple not to tell one. No man in this
country pretends either to tenderness or to indifference,
when he feels no disposition to be
indifferent or tender; and so removed are
they from all affectation of sensibility or of refinement,
that when a conceited Englishman
starts back in pretended rapture from a Raphael
he has perhaps little taste for, it is difficult
to persuade these sincerer people that his
transports are possibly put on, only to deceive
some of his countrymen who stand by, and
who, if he took no notice of so fine a picture,
would laugh, and say he had been throwing
his time away, without making even the common
and necessary improvements expected
from every gentleman who travels through
Italy; yet surely it is a choice delight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
live where the everlasting scourge held over
London and Bath, of <em>what will they think?</em>
and <em>what will they say?</em> has no existence;
and to reflect that I have now sojourned
near two years in Italy, and scarcely can name
one conceited man, or one affected woman,
with whom, in any rank of life, I have been
in the least connected.</p>

<p>In Naples we see the works of nature displayed;
at Rome and Florence we survey
the performances of art; at every place in
Italy there is much worthy one’s esteem, said
the Venetian Resident one day very elegantly;
and at Milan there is the <em>Abate Bossi</em>. Should
I forbear to add <em>my</em> testimony to such talents
and such virtue, which, expanded by nature
to the wide range of human benevolence, he
knows how to concentre occasionally for the
service of private friendship, how great would
be my ingratitude and neglect, while no
character ever so completely resembled his, as
that of the famous <em>Hough</em> well known in
England by the title of the <em>good</em> Bishop of
Worcester. His ingenuity in composing and
placing these words on the 13th of May
1775, is perhaps one of his least valuable
jeux d’esprit; but pretty, when one knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that on that day the empress was born, on
that day the archduke arrived at Milan on
a visit to his brother, and on that day the
duchess was delivered of a son. The words
may be read our way or the Chinese:</p>

<p>What a foolish thing it is in princes to give
pain in a place like this, where all are disposed
to derive pleasure even from praising them!
There is a natural loyalty among the Lombards,
which oppression can scarcely extinguish,
or tyranny destroy; and, as I have said a
thousand times, they <em>pretend</em> to love no one;
they <em>do</em> love their rulers; and, rather grieve
than growl at the afflictions caused by their
rapacity.</p>

<p>I was told that I should find few discriminations
of character in Italy; but the contrary
proves true, and I do not wonder at it. Among
those people who, by being folded or driven
all together in flocks as the French are, with
one fashion to serve for the whole society, a
man may easily contract a similarity of manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
by rubbing down each asperity of character
against his nearest neighbour, no less
plastic than himself; but here, where there
is little apprehension of ridicule, and little spirit
of imitation, monotonous tediousness is almost
sure to be escaped. The very word <em>polite</em>
comes from <em>polish</em> I suppose; and at Paris
the place where you enjoy <i lang="fr">le veritable vernis
St. Martin</i> in perfection, the people can
scarcely be termed <em>polished</em>, or even <em>varnished</em>:
they are <em>glazed</em>; and everything slides off
the <i lang="fr">exterieur</i> of course, leaving the heart untouched.
It is the same thing with other productions
of nature; in caverns we see petrifactions
shooting out in angular and excentric
forms, because in Castleton Hole dame Nature
has fair play; while the broad beach at
Brighthelmstone, evermore battered by the same
ocean, exhibits only a heap of round pebbles,
and those round pebbles all alike.</p>

<p>But we must cease reflections, and begin
describing again. We have got a country
house for the remaining part of the hot weather
upon the confines of the Milanese dominions,
where Switzerland first begins to
bow her bleak head, and soften gradually in
the sunshine of Italian fertility. From every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
walk and villa round this delightful spot, one
sees an assemblage of beauties rarely to be met
with: and there is a resemblance in it to the
Vale of Llwydd, which makes it still more interesting
to <em>me</em>. But we have obtained leave
to spend a week of our destined Villeggiatura
at the Borromæan palace, situated in the middle
of Lago Maggiore, on the island so truly
termed Isola Bella; every step to which from
our villa at Varese teems with new beauties,
and only wants the sea to render it, in point of
mere landscape, superior to any thing we have
seen yet.</p>

<p>Our manner of living here is positively
like nothing real, and the fanciful description
of oriental magnificence, with Seged’s retirement
in the Rambler to his palace on the Lake
Dambea, is all I ever read that could come
in competition with it: for here is one barge
full of friends from Milan, another carrying
a complete band of thirteen of the best musicians
in Italy, to amuse ourselves and them
with concerts every evening upon the water
by moonlight, while the inhabitants of these
elysian regions who live upon the banks, come
down in crowds to the shores glad to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
additional delight, where satiety of pleasure
seems the sole evil to be dreaded.</p>

<p>It is well known that the wild mountains of
Savoy, the rich plains of Lombardy, the verdant
pastures of Piedmont, and the pointed Alps
of Switzerland, form the limits of Lago Maggiore:
where, upon a naked rock, torn I
trust from some surrounding hill, or happily
thrown up in the middle of the water by a subterranean
volcano, the Count Borromæo, in the
year 1613, began to carry earth; and lay out a
pretty garden, which from that day has been perpetually
improving, till an appearance of eastern
grandeur which it now wears, is rendered still
more charming by all the studied elegance of
art, and the conveniencies of common life.
The palace is constructed as if to realise Johnson’s
ideas in his Prince of Abyssinia: the
garden consists of ten terraces; the walls of
which are completely covered with orange,
lemon, and cedrati trees, whose glowing colours
and whose fragrant scent are easily discerned
at a considerable distance, and the perfume
particularly often reaches as far as to the
opposite shore: nor are standards of the same
plants wanting. I measured one not the
largest in the grove, which had been planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
one hundred and five years; it was a full yard
and a quarter round. There were forty-six
of them set near each other, and formed a delightful
shade. The cedrati fruit grows as
large as a late romana melon with us in England;
and every thing one sees, and every
thing one hears, and every thing one tastes,
brings to one’s mind the fortunate islands and
the golden age. Walks, woods, and terraces
<em>within</em> the island, and a prospect of unequalled
variety <em>without</em>, make this a kind of
fairy habitation, so like something one has
seen represented on theatres, that my female
companion cried out as we approached the
place, “If we go any nearer now, I am sure
it will all vanish into air.” There is solidity
enough however: a little village consisting of
eighteen fishermen’s houses, and a pretty
church, with a dozen of well-grown poplars
before it, together with the palace and garden,
compose the territory, which commodiously
contains two hundred and fifty souls,
as the circuit is somewhat more than a measured
mile and a half, but not two miles in
all: and we have cannons to guard our Calypso-like
dominion, for which Count Borromæo
pays tribute to the king of Sardinia; but has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
himself the right of raising men upon the
main land, and of coining money at <em>Macau</em>,
a little town amid the hollows of these rocks,
which present their irregular fronts to the
lake in a manner surprisingly beautiful. He
has three other islets on the same water, for
change of amusement; of which that named
la Superiore is covered with a hamlet, and
l’Isola Madre with a wood full of game, guinea
fowl, and common poultry; a summer-house
beside furnished with chintz, and containing
so many apartments, that I am told
the uncle of the present possessor, having quarrelled
with his wife, and resolving in a
pet to leave the world, shut himself up on
that little spot of earth, and never touched
the continent, as I may call it, for the last
seventeen years of his life. Let me add, that
he had there his church and his chaplain,
three musical professors in constant pay, and
a pretty yatcht to row or sail, and fetch in
friends, physicians, &amp;c. from the main land.
His nephew has not the same taste at all,
seldom spending more than a week, and that
only once a-year, among his islands, which are
kept however quite in a princely style: the
family crest, a unicorn, made in white marble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and of colossal greatness, proudly overlooking
ten broad terraces which rise in a pyramidal
form from the water: each wall
richly covered with orange and lemon trees,
and every parapet concealed under thickly-flowering
shrubs of incessant variety, as if
every climate had been culled, to adorn this
tiny spot. More than a hundred beds are
made in the palace, which has likewise a grotto
floor of infinite ingenuity, and beautiful from
being happily contrasted against the general
splendour of the house itself. I have seen
no such effort of what we call taste since I left
England, as these apartments on a level with
the lake exhibit, being all roofed and wainscotted
with well-disposed shellwork, and decorated
with fountains in a lively and pleasing
manner. The library up stairs had many
curious books in it&mdash;a Camden’s Britannia
particularly, translated into Spanish; an Arabic
Bible worthy of the Bodleian collection,
and well-chosen volumes of natural history to
a very serious degree of expence. Painting
is not the first or second boast of Count Borromæo,
but there are some tolerable landscapes
by Tempesta, and three famous pictures
of Luca Giordano, well known in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
by the general diffusion of their prints,
representing the Rape of the Sabines, the
Judgment of Paris, and the Triumph of Galatea.
These large history pieces adorn the
walls of the vast room we dine in; where,
though we never sit down fewer than twenty
or twenty-five people to table, all seem lost
from the greatness of its size, till the concert
fills it in the evening.</p>

<p>It is the garden however more than the palace
which deserves description. He who has
the care of it was born upon the island, and
never strayed further than four miles, he tells
me, from the borders of his master’s lake.
Sure he must think the fall of man a fable:
<em>he</em> lives in Eden still. How much must such
a fellow be confounded, could he be carried
blind-folded in the midst of winter to London
or to Paris! and set down in Fleet-street or
Rue St. Honoré! That he understands his
business so as to need no tuition from the inhabitants
of either city, may be seen by a fig-tree
which I found here ingrafted on a lemon;
both bear fruit at the same moment, whilst a
vine curls up the stem of the lemon-tree,
dangling her grapes in that delicious company
with apparent satisfaction to herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Another inoculation of a moss-rose upon an
orange, and a third of a carnation upon a cedrati
tree, gave me new knowledge of what
the gardener’s art, aided by a happy climate,
could perform. But when rowing round the
lake with our band of music yesterday, we
touched at a country seat upon the side which
joins the Milanese dominion, and I found
myself presented with currants and gooseberries
by a kind family, who having made their
fortune in Amsterdam, had imbibed some
Dutch ideas; my mind immediately felt her
elastic force, and willingly confessed that liberty,
security, and opulence alone give the
true relish to productions either of art or nature;
that freedom can make the currants of
Holland and golden pippins of Great Britain
sweeter than all the grapes of Italy; while to
every manly understanding some share of the
government in a well-regulated state, with the
every-day comforts of common life made durable
and certain by the laws of a prosperous
country, are at last far preferable to splendid
luxuries precariously enjoyed under the consciousness
of their possible privation when least
expected by the hand of despotic power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Carlo Borromæo’s colossal statue in bronze
fixed up at the place of his nativity by the
side of this beautiful water, fifteen miles from
l’Isola Bella, was our next object of curiosity.
It is wonderfully well proportioned for its
prodigious magnitude, which, though often
measured and well known, will never cease
to astonish travellers, while twelve men can
be easily contained in his head only, as some
of our company had the curiosity to prove;
but repented their frolic, as the metal heated
by such a sun became insupportable. Abate
Bianconi bid me remark that it was just the
height of twelve men, each six feet high;
that it is but just once and a half less than
that erected by Nero, which gives name to
the Roman Colosseo; that it is to be seen
clearly at the distance of twelve miles, though
placed to no advantage, as situation has been
sacrificed to the greater propriety of setting it
up upon the place where he was actually
born, whose memory they hold, and justly, in
such perfect veneration. I returned home persuaded
that the cardinal’s dress, though an unfavourable
one to pictures, is very happily adapted
to a colossal statue, as the three cloaks or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
petticoats made a sort of step-ladder drapery
which takes off exceedingly from the offence
that is given by too long lines to the eye.</p>

<p>We returned to our enchanted palace with
music playing by our side: I never saw a
party of pleasure carried on so happily. The
weather was singularly bright and clear, the
moon at full, the French-horns breaking the
silence of the night, invited echo to answer
them. The nine days (and we enjoyed seventeen
or eighteen hours out of every twenty-four)
seemed nine minutes. When we came
home to our country-house in the Varesotto,
verses and sonnets saluted our arrival, and
congratulated our wedding-day.</p>

<p>The Madonna del Monte was the next
show which called us abroad; it is within a
few miles of our present sweet habitation, is
celebrated for its prospect, and is indeed a
very astonishing spot of ground, exhibiting at
one view the three cities of Turin, Milan, and
Genoa; and leading the eye still forward into
the South of France. The lakes, which to
those who go o’pleasuring upon them, seem
like seas, and very like the mouth of our river
Dart, where she disgorges her elegantly-ornamented
stream into the harbour at Kingsweare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
here afford too little water in proportion,
though five in number, and the largest
fifty miles round. I scarcely ever saw so much
land within the eye from any place. That
the road should be adorned with chapels up
the mountain is less strange: there is a church
dedicated to the Virgin at top. We have
one here in Italy in every district almost, as
the rage of <em>worshipping on high places</em>, so expressly
and repeatedly forbidden in scripture,
has lasted surprisingly in the world. Every
resting-place is marked, and decorated with
statues cut in wood, and painted to imitate
human life with very extraordinary skill.
They are capital performances of their kind,
and most resemble, but I think excel, Mrs.
Wright’s finest figures in wax. A convent
of nuns, situated on the summit of the hill,
where these chapels end in an exceeding pretty
church, entertained our large party with the
most hospitable kindness; gave us a handsome
dinner and delicious dessert. We diverted
the ladies with a little concert in return,
and passed a truly delightful day.</p>

<p>All the environs of this <i lang="it">Varesotto</i> are very
charmingly varied with mountains, lakes, and
cultivated life; the only fault in our prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
is the want of water. Had I told my companions
of yesterday perhaps, that the view
from <i lang="it">Madonna del Monte</i> reminded me of
Chirk Castle Hill in North Wales, they would
have laughed; yet from that extraordinary spot
are to be distinctly seen several fertile counties,
with many great, and many small towns, and
a most extensive landscape, watered by the
large and navigable rivers Severn and Dee,
roughened by the mountains of Merionethshire,
and bounded by the Irish sea: I think
that view has scarce its equal any where; and,
if any where, it is here in the vicinity of Varese,
where many gay villas interspersed contribute
to variegate and enliven a scene highly
finished by the hand of Nature, and wanting
little addition from her attendant <em>Art</em>.</p>

<p>Of the noblemen’s feats in the neighbourhood
it may indeed be remarked, that however
spacious the house, and however splendid
the furniture may prove upon examination,
however pompous the garden may be to the
first glance, and the terraces however magnificent,&mdash;spiders
are seldom excluded from the
mansion, or weeds from the pleasure-ground
of the possessor. A climate so warm would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
afford some excuse for this nastiness, could
one observe the inhabitants were discomposed
at such an effect from a good cause, or if one
could flatter one’s self that they themselves
were hurt at it; but when they gravely display
an embroidered bed or counterpane worthy
of Arachne’s fingers before her metamorphosis,
covered over by her present labours,
who can forbear laughing?&mdash;The gardener in
two minutes arriving to assist you up slopes,
all flourishing with cat’s-tail and poppy;
while your friends cry,&mdash;“<em>Here, this is nature!
is it not?</em> pure nature!&mdash;<i lang="it">Tutto naturale si,
secondo l’uso Inglese</i><a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.”</p>

<p>Well! we have really passed a prodigiously
gay <i lang="it">villegiatura</i> here in this charming country,
where the snowy cap of the <i lang="fr">gros</i> St. Bernard
cools the air, though at so great a distance;
and we have the pleasure of seeing
Switzerland, without the pain of feeling its
cold, or the fatigue of climbing its <i lang="fr">glacieres</i>:
the Alps of the Grisons rise up like a fortification
behind us; the sun glows hot in our
rich and fertile valleys, and throws up every
vegetable production with all the poignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
flavour that Summer can bestow; nor is shade
wanting from the walnut and large chesnut
trees, under which we often dine, and sing,
and play at <i lang="it">tarocco</i>, and hear the horns and
clarinets, while sipping our ice or swallowing
our lemonade. The <i lang="it">cicala</i> now feels the
genial influence of that heat she requires, but
her voice here is weak, compared to the
powers she displayed so much to our disturbance
in Tuscany; and the <i lang="it">lucciola</i> has lost
much of her scintillant beauty, but she darts
up and down the hedges now and then.
Here is an emerald-coloured butterfly, whose
name I know not, plays over the lakes and
standing pools, in a very pleasing abundance;
the most exquisitely-tinted æphemera frolic
before one all day long; and Antiope flutters
in every parterre, and shares the garden sweets
with a pale primrose-coloured creature of her
own kind, whose wings are edged with
brown, and, if I can remember right, bears
the name of <em>hyale</em>. But we are not yet past
the residence of scorpions, which certainly
do commit suicide when provoked beyond all
endurance; a story I had always heard, but
never gave much credit to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>But I am disturbed from writing my book
by the good-humoured gaiety of our cheerful
friends, with whom we never sit down fewer
than fourteen or fifteen to table I think, and
surely never rise from it without many a genuine
burst of honest merriment undisguised
by affectation, unfettered by restraint. Our
gentlemen make <i lang="it">improviso</i> rhymes, and cut
comical faces; go out to the field after dinner,
and play at a sort of blindman’s buff, which
they call breaking the pan; nor do the low
ones in company arrange their minds as I see
in compliment to the high ones, but tell their
opinions with a freedom I little expected to
find: mixed society is very rare among them,
almost unknown it seems; but when they <em>do</em>
mix at a country place like this, the great are
kind, to do them justice, and the little not servile.
They are wise indeed in making society
easy to them, for no human being suffers solitude
so ill as does an Italian. An English lady
once made me observe, that a cat never purs
when she is alone, let her have what meat and
warmth she will; I think these social-spirited
Milanese are like <em>her</em>, for they can hardly
believe that there is existing a person, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
would not willingly prefer any company to
none: when we were at the islands three
weeks ago,&mdash;“A charming place,” says one
of our companions,&mdash;“<i lang="it">Cioè con un mondo
d’amici cosi</i><a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.”&mdash;“But with one’s own family,
methinks,” said I, “and a good library of
books, and this sweet lake to bathe in:”&mdash;“O!”
cried they all at once, “<i lang="it">Dio ne liberi</i><a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.”&mdash;This
is national character.</p>

<p>Why there are no birds of the watery kind,
coots, wild ducks, cargeese, upon these lakes,
nobody informs me: I have been often told
that of Geneva swarms with them, and it is
but a very few miles off: our people though
have little care to ascertain such matters, and
no desire at all to investigate effects and causes;
those who study among them, study classic
authors and learn rhetoric; poetry too is by
no means uncultivated at Milan, where the
Abate Parini’s satires are admirable, and so
esteemed by those who themselves know very
well how to write, and how to judge: common
philosophy (<i lang="fr">la physique</i>, as the French
call it), geography, astronomy, chymistry, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
oddly left behind somehow; and it is to their
ignorance of these matters that I am apt to
impute Italian credulity, to which every
wonder is welcome.</p>

<p>We have now passed one day in Switzerland
however, rowing to the little town Lugano
over its pretty lake. The mountains at
the end are a neat miniature of Vesuvius,
Somma, &amp;c.; and the situation altogether
looks as a picture of Naples would look, if
painted by Brughuel; but not so full of figures.
A fanciful traveller too might be tempted to think
he could discern some streaks of liberty in the
manners of the people, if it were but in the
inn-keeper at whose house we dined; this
may however be merely my own prejudice,
and somebody told me it was so.</p>

<p>We were shewn on one side the water as
we went across, a small place called Campioni,
which is <i lang="it">feudo Imperiale</i>, and governed by the
Padre Abate of a neighbouring convent, who
has power even over the lives of his subjects
for six years; at the expiration of which term
another despot of the day is chosen&mdash;appointed
I should have said; and the last returns to his
original state, amenable however for any <em>very</em>
shocking thing he may have done during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
course of his dictatorship; and no complaint
has been ever made yet of any such governor
so circumstanced and appointed, whose conduct
is commonly but too mild and clement.
This I thought worth remarking, as consolatory
to one’s feelings.</p>

<p>Lugano meantime scorns absolute authority:
our Cicerone there, in reply to the
question asked in Italy three times a-day I
believe&mdash;<i lang="it">Che Principe fà qui la sua residenza?</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>&mdash;replied,
that they were plagued with no
Principi at all, while the thirteen Cantons
protected all their subjects; and though, as
the man expressed it, only half of them were
<em>Christians</em>, and the other half <em>Protestants</em>; no
church or convent had ever wanted respect;
while their town regularly received a monthly
governor from every canton, and was perfectly
contented with this ambulatory dominion.
Here was the first gallows I have seen
these two years. They have a pretty commerce
too at Lugano for the size of the place,
and the shopkeepers shew that officiousness
and attention seldom observed in arbitrary
states, where</p>

<p class="noindent">soon leads people to neglect the trouble of
getting, for the pleasure of spending their
money. One therefore sees the inhabitants of
Italian cities for the most part merry and
cheerful, or else pious and penitent; little attentive
to their shops, but easily disposed to
loiter under their mistress’s window with a
guitar, or rove about the streets at night with
a pretty girl under their arm, singing as they
go, or squeaking with a droll accent, if it is
the time for masquerades. Fraud, avarice,
ambition, are the vices of republican states
and a cold climate; idleness, sensuality, and
revenge, are the weeds of a warm country
and monarchical governments. If these people
are not good, they at least wish they were
better; they do not applaud their own conduct
when their passions carry them too far; nor
rejoice, like old Moneytrap or Sir Giles Overreach,
in their successful sins: but rather say
with Racine’s hero, translated by Philips, that</p>

<p class="noindent">They beat their bosoms at the feet of a crucifix in
the street, with no more hypocrisy than they beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
a tambourine there; perhaps with no more
effect neither, if no alteration of behaviour succeeds
their contrition: yet when an Englishman
(who is probably more ashamed of repenting
than of sinning) accuses them of false
pretensions to pious fervour, he wrongs them,
and would do well to repent himself.</p>

<p>But a natural curiosity seen at Milan this
16th day of August 1786, leads my mind
into another channel. I went to wait upon
and thank the lady, or the relations of the
lady, who lent us her house at Varese, and
make our proper acknowledgments; and at
that visit saw something very uncommon
surely: though I remember Doctor Johnson
once said, that nobody had ever seen a very
strange thing; and challenged the company
(about seventeen people, myself among them)
to produce a strange thing;&mdash;but I had not
then seen Avvocato B&mdash;&mdash;, a lawyer here at
Milan, and a man respected in his profession,
who actually chews the cud like an ox;
which he did at my request, and in my presence:
he is apparently much like another tall
stout man, but has many extraordinary properties,
being eminent for strength, and possessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a set of ribs and sternum very surprising,
and worthy the attention of anatomists:
his body, upon the slightest touch, even
through all his clothes, throws out electric
sparks; he can reject his meals from his stomach
at pleasure, and did absolutely in the
course of two hours, the only two I ever passed
in his company, go through, to oblige me,
the whole operation of eating, masticating,
swallowing, and returning by the mouth, a
large piece of bread and a peach. With all
this conviction, nothing more was wanting;
but I obtained beside, the confirmation of common
friends, who were willing likewise to
bear testimony of this strange accidental variety.
What I hear of his character is, that
he is a low-spirited, nervous man; and I suppose
his <em>ruminating</em> moments are spent in
lamenting the singularities of his frame:&mdash;be
this how it will, we have now no time to
think any more of them, as we are packing
up for a trip to Bergamo, a city I have not
yet seen.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<h2>BERGAMO</h2>

<p>Is built up a steep hill, like Lansdown
road at Bath; the buildings not so regular;
the prospect not inferior, but of a different
kind, resembling that one sees from Wrotham
hill in Kent, but richer, and presenting a
variety beyond credibility, when it is premised
that scarce any water can be seen, and
that the plains of Lombardy are low and flat:
within the eye however one may count all
the original blessings bestowed on humankind,&mdash;corn,
wine, oil, and fruit;&mdash;the inclosures
being small too, and the trees <i lang="fr">touffu</i>,
as the French call it. No parterre was ever
more beautifully disposed than are the fields
surveyed from the summit of the hill, where
stands the Marquis’s palace elegantly sheltered
by a still higher rising ground behind
it, and commanding from every window of
its stately front a view of prodigious extent
and almost unmatched beauty: as the diversification
of colouring reminds one of nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
but the fine pavement at the Roman Pantheon,
so curiously intersected are the patches
of grass and grain, flax and vines, arable and
tilth, in this happy disposition of earth and
its most valuable products; while not a hedge
fails to afford perfume that fills the very air
with fragrance, from the sweet jessamine that,
twisting through it, lends a weak support to
the wild grapes, which, dangling in clusters,
invite ten thousand birds of every European
species I believe below the size of a pigeon.
Nor is the taking of these creatures by the
<i lang="it">roccolo</i> to be left out from among the amusements
of Brescian and Bergamasc nobility;
nor is the eating of them when taken to be
despised: <i lang="it">beccaficos</i> and <i lang="it">ortolans</i> are here in
high perfection; and it was from these
northern districts of Italy I trust that Vitellius,
and all the classic gluttons of antiquity, got
their curious dishes of singing-bird pye, &amp;c.
The rich scent of melons at every cottage door
is another delicious proof of the climate’s fertility
and opulence,&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">as Hughes expresses it; and where, in the delightful
villa of our highly accomplished acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the Marquis of Aracieli, we have passed
ten days in all the pleasures which wit could
invent, money purchase, or friendship bestow.
The last nobleman who resided here, father to
the present lord, was <i lang="it">cavalier servente</i> to the immortal
Clelia Borromæo, whose virtues and
varieties of excellence would fill a volume;
nor can there be a stronger proof of her uncommon,
almost unequalled merit, than the
long-continued esteem of the famous Vallisnieri,
whose writings on natural history, particularly
insects, are valued for their learning,
as their author was respected for his birth and
talents. Letters from him are still preserved
in the family by Marchese Aracieli, and breathe
admiration of the conduct, beauty, and extensive
knowledge possessed by this worthy descendant
of the Borromæan house; to whose
incomparable qualities his father’s steady attachment
bore the truest testimony, while the
son still speaks of her death with tears, and
delights in nothing more than in paying just
tribute to her memory. He shewed me this
pretty distich in her praise, made improviso
by the celebrated philosopher Vallisnieri:</p>

<p class="noindent">The Italians are exceedingly happy in the
power of making verses improviso, either in

<p class="noindent">Though this latter has been preserved with
many deserved eulogiums from Crescembini,
and likewise by Mr. de Chevreau.</p>

<p>Could I clear my head of prejudice for such
talents as I find here, and my heart of partial
regard, which is in reality but grateful friendship,
justly due from me for so many favours
received; could I forget that we are now once
more in the state of Venice, where every thing
assumes an air of cheerfulness unknown to
other places, I might perhaps perceive that the
fair at Bergamo differs little from a fair in
England, except that these cattle are whiter
and ours larger. <cite>How a score of good ewes
now?</cite> as Master Shallow says; but I really
did ask the price of a pair of good strong
oxen for work, and heard it was ten zecchines;
about half the price given at Blackwater, but
ours are stouter, and capable of rougher service.
It is strange to me where these creatures are
kept all the rest of the year, for except at fair
time one very seldom sees them, unless in
actual employment of carting, ploughing, &amp;c.
Nothing is so little animated by the sight of
living creatures as an Italian prospect. No
sheep upon their hills, no cattle grazing in their
meadows, no water-fowl, swans, ducks, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
upon their lakes; and when you leave Lombardy,
no birds flying in the air, save only from
time to time betwixt Florence and Bologna, a
solitary kite soaring over the surly Appenines,
and breaking the immense void which fatigues
the eye; a ragged lad or wench too now and
then leading a lean cow to pick among the
hedges, has a melancholy appearance, the more
so as it is always fast held by a string, and
struggles in vain to get loose. These however
are only consequences of luxuriant plenty, for
where the farmer makes four harvests of his
grass, and every other speck of ground is profitably
covered with grain, vines, &amp;c. all possibility
of open pasturage is precluded. Horses
too, so ornamental in an English landscape,
will never be seen loose in an Italian one, as
they are all <i lang="fr">chevaux entiers</i>, and cannot be
trusted in troops together as ours are, even
if there was ground uninclosed for them
to graze on, like the common lands in Great
Britain. A nobleman’s park is another object
never to be seen or expected in a country,
where people would really be deserving much
blame did they retain in their hands for mere
amusement ten or twelve miles circuit of earth,
capable to produce two or three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
pounds a-year profit to their families, beside
making many tenants rich and happy in the
mean time. I will confess, however, that the
absence of all these <i lang="fr">agrèmens</i> gives a flatness
and uniformity to the views which we cannot
complain of in England; but when Italians
consider the cause, they will have reason to be
satisfied with the effect, especially while vegetable
nature flourishes in full perfection, while
every step crushes out perfume from the trodden
herbs, and those in the hedges dispense with
delightful liberality a fragrance that enchants
one. Hops and pyracanthus cover the sides
of every cottage; and the scent of truffles attracts,
and the odour of melons gratifies one’s
nerves, when driving among the habitations
of fertile Lombardy.</p>

<p>The old church here of mingled Gothic
and Grecian architecture pleased me exceedingly,
it sends one back to old times so, and
shews one the progress of <em>barbarism</em>, rapid and
gigantic in its strides, to overturn, confound,
and destroy what taste was left in the world
at the moment of its <em>onset</em>. Here is a picture
of the Israelites passing over the Red Sea,
which Luca Giordano, contrary to his usual
custom, seems to have taken pains with, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
rarity of course; and here are some single
figures of the prophets, heroes, and judges of
the Old Testament, painted with prodigious
spirit indeed, by Ciro Ferri. That which
struck me as most capital, was Gideon wringing
the dew out of the fleece, full of character
and glowing with expression.</p>

<p>The theatre has fallen down, but they are
building it up again with a nicety of proportion
that will ensure it from falling any more.
Italians cannot live without a theatre; they
have erected a temporary one to serve during
the fair time, and even that is beautiful. The
Terzetto of charming Guglielmi was sung last
night; I liked it still better than when we
heard it performed by singers of more established
reputation at St. Carlo; but then I
like every thing at Bergamo, till it comes to
the thunder storms, which are far more innoxious
here than at Naples or in Tuscany.</p>

<p>We could contemplate electricity from this
fine hill yesterday with great composure, being
amused with her caprices and not endangered
by her anger. There has however been a
fierce tempest in the neighbourhood, which
has greatly lowered the spirits of the farmer;
and we have been told another tale, that lowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
mine much more as an Englishwoman, because
the people of this town complain of strange
failure in their accustomed orders for silk from
England, and the foreigners make disgraceful
conjectures about our commerce, in consequence
of that failure.</p>

<p>Here is a report prevailing too, of King
George III. being assassinated, which, though
we all know to be false, fails not to produce
much unpleasing talk. Were the Londoners
aware of the diffusion of their newspapers, and
the strange ideas taken up by foreigners about
things which pass by <em>us</em> like a day dream, I
think more caution would be used, and characters
less lightly hung up to infamy or ridicule,
on which those very prints mean not to
bestow so lasting or severe a punishment, as
their ill word produces at a distance from
home, whither the contradiction often misses
though the report arrives, and mischief, originally
little intended, becomes the fatal consequence
of a joke. But it is time to return to</p>

<h2>MILAN,</h2>

<p>Whence I went for my very first airing
to Casa Simonetti, in search of the echo so
celebrated by my country-folks and fellow-travellers,
but did not find all that has been
said of it strictly true. It certainly does repeat
a single sound more than seventy times,
but has no power to give back by reverberation
a whole sentence. I have met too with
another petty mortification; having been
taught by Cave to expect, that in our Ambrosian
library here at Milan, there was a
MS. of Boethius preserved relative to his condemnation,
and confessing his design of subverting
the Gothic government in Lombardy.
I therefore prevailed on Canonico Palazzi, a
learned old ecclesiastic, to go with me and beg
a sight of it. The præfect politely promised
indulgence, but referred me to a future day;
and when we returned again at the time appointed,
shewed me only Pere Mabillon’s book,
in which we read that it is to be found no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
where but at Florence, in the library of Lorenzo
de Medicis. We were however shewn
some curiosities to compensate our trouble, particularly
the skeleton of the lady mentioned by
Dr. Moore and Lady Millar with some contempt.
This is the copy of her inscription:</p>

<p class="center">ÆGROTANTIUM<br />
SANITATI<br />
MORTUORUM<br />
INSPECTIONE<br />
VIVENTES<br />
PROSPICERE<br />
POSSINT<br />
HUNC<br />
ΣΚΕΛΕΤΟΝ<br />
P.</p>

<p>A MS. of the Consolations of Philosophy,
very finely written in the tenth century, and
kept in elegant preservation;&mdash;a private common-place
of Leonardo da Vinci never shewn,
full of private memoirs, caricaturas, hints for
pictures, sketches, remarks, &amp;c.; it is invaluable.
But there is another treasure in this
town, the præfect tells me, by the same inimitable
master, no other than an alphabet,
pater noster, &amp;c. written out by himself for
the use of his own little babies, and ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with vignettes, &amp;c. to tempt them to study
it. I shall not see it however, as Conte Trivulci
is out of town, to whom it belongs. I
have not neglected to go see the monument
erected to one of his family, with the famous
inscription,</p>

<p class="noindent">preserved by father Bouhours. The same
day shewed me the remains of a temple to
Hercules, with many of the fine old pillars
still standing. They are soon to be taken
down we hear for the purpose of widening
the street, as Carfax was at Oxford.</p>

<p>My hunger after a journey to Pavia is much
abated; since professor Villa, whose erudition
is well known, and whose works do him so
much honour, informed me that the inscription
said by Pere Mabillon still to subsist in
praise of Boethius, is long since perished by
time; nor do they now shew the brick tower
in which it is said he was confined while he
wrote his Consolations of Philosophy: for the
tower is fallen to the ground, and so is the
report, every body being now persuaded that
they were composed in a strong place then
standing upon the spot called Calventianus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Ager, from the name of a noble house to
which it had belonged for ages, and which I
am told Cicero mentions as a family half
Placentian, half Milaneze. The field still
goes by the name of <i lang="it">Il Campo Calvenziano</i>;
but, as it now belongs to people careless of
remote events, however interesting to literature,
is not adorned by any obelisk, or other
mark, to denote its past importance, in having
been once the scene of sufferings gloriously
endured by the most zealous christian,
the most steady patriot, and the most
refined philosopher of the age in which he
lived.</p>

<p>I have seen a fine MS. of the Consolations
copied in the tenth century, not only legible
but beautiful; and I have been assured that
the hymns written by his first wife Elpis,
who, though she brought him no children,
as Bertius says, was yet <i lang="la">fida curarum, et studiorum
socia</i><a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, are still sung in the Romish
churches at Brescia and Bergamo, somewhat
altered from the state we find them in at the
end of Cominus’s edition of the Consolations.</p>

<p>Tradition too, I find, agrees with Procopius
in telling that this widow of Boethius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Rusticiana, daughter of Symmachus, spent all
the little money she had left in hiring people
to throw down in the night all the statues set up
in Rome to the honour of Theodoric, who had
sentenced her husband to a death so dreadful,
that it gave occasion to many fabulous tales
reported by Martin Rota as miraculous
truths. His bones, gathered up as relics by
Otho III., were placed in a chapel dedicated
to St. Austin in St. Peter’s church at Pavia
four hundred and seventy-two years after his
death, with an epitaph preserved by Pere
Mabillon, but now no longer legible.</p>

<p>We are now cutting hay here for the last
time this season, and all the environs smell
like spring on this 15th September 1786.
The autumnal tint, however, falls fast upon
the trees, which are already rich with a deep
yellow hue. A wintery feel upon the atmosphere
early in a morning, heavy fogs about
noon, and a hollow wind towards the approach
of night, make it look like the very
last week of October in England, and warn
us that summer is going. The same circumstances
prompt me, who am about to forsake
this her favourite region, to provide furs,
flannels, &amp;c. for the passing of those Alps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which look so formidable when covered with
snow at their present distance. Our
swallows are calling their clamorous council
round me while I write; but the butterflies
still flutter about in the middle of the day,
and grapes are growing more wholesome as
with us when the mornings begin to be
frosty. Our deserts, however, do not remind
us of Tuscany: the cherries here are not
particularly fine, and the peaches all part
from the stone&mdash;miserable things! an English
gardener would not send them to table: the
figs too were infinitely finer at Leghorn, and
nectarines have I never seen at all.</p>

<p>Well, here is the opera begun again;
some merry wag, Abate Casti I think, has
accommodated and adapted the old story of
king Theodore to put in ridicule the present
king of Sweden, who is hated of the emperor
for some political reasons I forget what, and
he of course patronises the jester. Our honest
Lombards, however, take no delight in
mimicry, and feel more disgust than pleasure
when simplicity is insulted, or distress
made more corrosive by the bitterness of a
scoffing spirit. I have tried to see whether
they would laugh at any oddity in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
neighbour’s manner, but never could catch
any, except perhaps now and then a sly Roman
who had a liking for it. “I see nothing
absurd about the man,” says one gentleman;
“every body may have some peculiarity, and
most people have; but such things make me
no sport: let us, when we have a mind to
laugh, go and laugh at Punchinello.”&mdash;From
such critics, therefore, the king of Sweden is
safe enough, as they have not yet acquired the
taste of hunting down royalty, and crowing
with infantine malice, when possessed of the
mean hope that they are able to pinch a noble
heart. This old-fashioned country, which
detests the sight of suffering majesty, hisses off
its theatre a performance calculated to divert
them at the expence of a sovereign prince,
whose character is clear from blame, and
whose personal weaknesses are protected by
his birth and merit; while it is to his open,
free, and politely generous behaviour alone, they
owe the knowledge that he <em>has</em> such foibles.
Paisiello, therefore, cannot drive it down
by his best music, though the poor king of
Sweden is a Lutheran too, and if any thing
would make them hate him, <em>that</em> would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>One vice, however, sometimes prevents the
commission of another, and that same prevailing
idea which prompts these prejudiced
Romanists to conclude him doomed to lasting
torments who dares differ from them, though
in points of no real importance, inspires them
at the same time with such compassion for his
supposed state of predestinated punishment, that
they rather incline to defend him from further
misery, and kindly forbear to heap ridicule in
this world upon a person who is sure to suffer
eternal damnation in the other.</p>

<p>How melancholy that people who possess
such hearts should have the head thus perversely
turned! I can attribute it but to one
cause; their strange neglect and forbearance
to read and study God’s holy word: for not a
very few of them have I found who seem to
disbelieve the Old Testament entirely, yet remain
steadily and strenuously attached to the
precedence their church claims over every
other; and who shall wonder if such a combination
of bigotry with scepticism should
produce an evaporation of what little is left of
popery from the world, as emetics triturated
with opium are said to produce a sudorific
powder which no earthly constitution can resist?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Spanish grandee, who not only entertained
but astonished us all one night with
his conversation at Quirini’s Casino at Venice,
is arrived here at Milan, and plays upon the
violin. He challenged acquaintance with us
in the street, half invited himself to our private
concert last night, and did us the honour
to perform there, with the skill of a professor,
the eager desire of a dilletante, and the tediousness
of a solitary student; he continued to
amaze, delight, and fatigue us for four long
hours together. He is a man of prodigious
talents, and replete with variety of knowledge.
A new dance has been tried at here too, but
was not well received, though it represents
the terrible story which, under Madame de
Genlis’ pen, had such uncommon success
among the reading world, and is called
<i lang="it">La sepolta viva</i>; but as the duchess Girafalco,
whose misfortune it commemorates, is
still alive, the pantomime will probably be
suppressed: for she has relations at Milan it
seems, and one lady distinguished for elegance
of form, and charms of voice and manner,
told me yesterday with equal sweetness, spirit,
and propriety, that though the king of Naples
sent his soldiers to free her aunt from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
horrible dungeon where she had been nine
years confined, yet if her miseries were to
become the subject of stage representation, she
could hardly be pronounced happy, or
even at ease. Truth is, I would be loath to
see the spirit of producing every one’s private
affairs, true or false, before the public eye, spread
into <em>this</em> country: No! let that humour be
confined to Great Britain, where the thousand
real advantages resulting from living in a free
state, richly compensate for the violations of
delicacy annexed to it; and where the laws
do protect, though the individuals insult one:
but <em>here</em>, why the people would be miserable
indeed, if to the oppression which may any
hour be exercised over them by their prince,
were likewise to be added the liberties taken
perpetually in London by one’s next door
neighbour, of tearing forth every transaction,
and publishing even every conjecture to
one’s disadvantage.</p>

<p>With these reflections, and many others,
excited by gratitude to private friends, and
general admiration of a country so justly
esteemed, we shall soon take our leave of
Milan, famed for her truly hospitable disposition;
a temper of mind sometimes abused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
travellers perhaps, whose birth and pretensions
are seldom or ever inquired into, whilst
no people are more careful of keeping their
rank inviolate by never conversing on equal
terms with a countryman or woman of their
own, who cannot produce a proper length of
ancestry.</p>

<p>I will not leave them though, without
another word or two about their language,
which, though it sounded strangely coarse
and broad to be sure, as we returned home
from Florence, Rome, and Venice, I felt
sincerely glad to hear again; and have some
notion by their way of pronouncing <i lang="it">bicchiere</i>,
a word used here to express every thing that
holds water, that our <em>pitcher</em> was probably
derived from it; and the Abate Divecchio, a
polite scholar, and an uncommonly agreeable
companion, seemed to think so too. His
knowledge of the English language, joined to
the singular power he has over his own elegant
Tuscan tongue, made me torment him
with a variety of inquiries about these confusing
dialects, which leave me at last little
chance to understand any, whilst a child is
called <i lang="it">bambino</i> at Florence, <i lang="it">putto</i> at Venice,
<i lang="it">schiatto</i> at Bergamo, and <i lang="it">creatura</i> at Rome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and at Milan they call a wench <i lang="it">tosa</i>: an
apron is <i lang="it">grembiule</i> at Florence I think, <i lang="it">traversa</i>
at Venice, <i lang="it">bigarrol</i> at Brescia and some
other parts of Lombardy, <i lang="it">senale</i> at Rome,
and at Milan <i lang="it">scozzà</i>. A foreigner may well
be distracted by varieties so striking; but the
turn and idiom differ ten times more still, and
I love to hear our Milanese call an oak <i lang="it">robur</i>
rather than <i lang="it">quercia</i> somehow, and tell a lady
when dressed in white, that she is <i lang="it">tutto in
albedine</i>.</p>

<p>On Friday the 22d of September then we left
Milan, and I dropt a tear or two in remembrance
of the many civilities shewn by our
kind and partial companions. The Abate Bianconi
made me wild to go to Dresden, and
enjoy the Correggios now moved from Modena
to that gallery. I find he thinks the
old Romans pronounced Cicero and Cæsar as
the moderns do, and many English scholars
are of the same mind; but here are coins
dug up now out of the Veronese mountain
with the word Carolus, spelt <em>Karrulus</em>, upon
them quite plain; and Christus was spelt
<em>Kristus</em> in Vespasian’s time it is certain, because
of the player’s monument at Rome.&mdash;Dr.
Johnson, I remember, was always steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to that opinion; but it is time to leave all
this, and rejoice in my third arrival at gay,
cheerful, charming</p>

<hr />

<h2>VERONA,</h2>

<p>Whither some sweet leave-taking verses
have followed us, written by the facetious
Abate Ravasi, a native of Rome, but for
many years an inhabitant of Milan. His
agreeable sonnet, every line ending with
<i lang="it">tutto</i>, being upon a subject of general importance,
would serve as a better specimen of his
abilities than lines dictated only by partial
friendship;&mdash;but I hear <em>that</em> is already circulated
about the world, and printed in one of
our magazines; to them let him trust his
fame, they will pay my just debts.</p>

<p>We have now seen this enchanting spot in
spring, summer, and autumn; nor could
winter’s self render it undelightful, while
uniting every charm, and gratifying every
sense. Greek and Roman antiquities salute one
at the gates; Gothic remains render each
place of worship venerable: Nature in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
holiday dress decks the environs, and society
animates with intellectual fire the amiable
inhabitants. Oh! were I to live here long, I
should not only excuse, but applaud the Scaligers
for straining probability, and neglecting
higher praise, only to claim kindred with
the Scalas of Verona. Improvisation at this
place pleases me far better than it did in Tuscany.
Our truly-learned Abate Lorenzi astonishes
all who hear him, by <em>repeating</em>, not
<em>singing</em>, a series of admirably just and well-digested
thoughts, which he, and he alone,
possesses the power of arranging suddenly as
if by magic, and methodically as if by study, to
rhymes the most melodious, and most varied;
while the Abbé Bertola, of the university at
Pavia, gives one pleasure by the same talent
in a manner totally different, singing his unpremeditated
strains to the accompaniment of
a harpsichord, round which stand a little chorus
of friends, who interpolate from time to
time two lines of a well-known song, to which
he pleasingly adapts his compositions, and
goes on gracing the barren subject, and adorning
it with every possible decoration of wit,
and every desirable elegance of sentiment.
Nothing can surely surpass the happy promptitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of his expression, unless it is the brilliancy
of his genius.</p>

<p>We were in a large company last night, where
a beautiful woman of quality came in dressed
according to the present taste, with a gauze
head-dress, adjusted turbanwise, and a heron’s
feather; the neck wholly bare. Abate Bertola
bid me look at her, and, recollecting himself
a moment, made this Epigram improviso:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="it">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Volto e Crin hai di Sultana,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Perchè mai mi vien disdetto,</div>
<div class="verse">Sodducente Mussulmana</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Di gittarti il <em>Fazzoletto</em>?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of which I can give no better imitation than
the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">While turban’d head and plumage high</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A Sultaness proclaims my Cloe;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus tempted, tho’ no Turk, I’ll try</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The handkerchief you scorn&mdash;to throw ye.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is however a weak specimen of his
powers, whose charming fables have so completely,
in my mind, surpassed all that has
ever been written in that way since La Fontaine.
I am strongly tempted to give one
little story out of his pretty book.</p>

<p>But I will not be seduced by the pleasure of
praising my sweet friends at Verona, to
lengthen this chapter with further panegyrics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
upon a place I leave with the truest tenderness,
and with the sincerest regret; while the
correspondence I hope long to maintain with
the charming Contessa Mosconi, must compensate
all it can for the loss of her agreeable
Coterie, where my most delightful evenings
have been spent; where so many topics of
English literature have been discussed; where
Lorenzi read Tasso to us of an afternoon, Bertola
made verses, and the cavalier Pindemonte
conversed; where the three Graces, as they
are called, joined their sweet voices to sing
when satiety of pleasure made us change our
mode of being happy, and kept one from
wishing ever to hear any thing else; while
countess Carminati sung Bianchi’s duets with
the only tenor fit to accompany a voice so
touching, and a taste so refined. <i lang="la">Verona! qui
te viderit, et non amarit</i>, says some old
writer, I forget who, <i lang="la">protinus amor perditissimo;
is credo se ipsum non amat</i><a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Indeed
I never saw people live so pleasingly together
as these do; the women apparently delighting
in each other’s company, without mean rivalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
or envy of those accomplishments which are
commonly bestowed by heaven with diversity
enough for all to have their share. The
world surely affords room for every body’s
talents, would every body that possessed them
but think so; and were malice and affectation
once completely banished from cultivated society,
<em>Verona</em> might be found in many places
perhaps; she is now confined, I think, to
the sweet state of <em>Venice</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">JOURNEY<br />
through<br />
TRENT, INSPRUCK, MUNICK, and<br />
SALTZSBURG, to VIENNA.</span></h2>

<p>The Tyrolese Alps are not as beautiful
as those of Savoy, though the river
that runs between them is wider too; but
that very circumstance takes from the horror
which constitutes beauty in a rocky country,
while a navigable stream and the passage of
large floats convey ideas of commerce and social
life, leaving little room for the solitary
fancies produced, and the strokes of sublimity
indelibly impressed, by the mountains of La
Haute Morienne. The sight of a town where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
all the theological learning of Europe was
once concentred, affords however much ground
of mental amusement; while the sight of two
nations, not naturally congenial, living happily
together, as the Germans and Italians here
do, is pleasing to all.</p>

<p>We saw the apartments of the Prince Bishop,
but found few things worth remarking,
except that in the pictures of Carlo Loti there
is a shade of the Flemish school to be discerned,
which was pretty as we are now hard upon
the confines. Our sovereign here keeps his
little menagerie in a mighty elegant style: the
animals possess an insulated rock, surrounded
by the Adige, and planted with every thing
that can please them best; the wild, or more
properly the predatory creatures, are confined,
but in very spacious apartments; with
each a handsome outlet for amusement:
while such as are granivorous rove at pleasure
over their domain, to which their master
often comes in summer to eat ice at a banquetting
house erected for him in the middle,
whence a prospect of a peculiar nature is enjoyed;
great beauty, much variety, and a very
limited horizon, like some of the views about
Bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>At the death of one prince another is chosen,
and government carried on as at Rome in miniature.
We staid here two nights and one
day, thought perpetually of Matlock and Ivy
Bridge, and saw some rarities belonging to a
man who shewed us a picture of our Saviour’s
circumcision, and told us it was <em>San Simeone</em>,
a baby who having gone through many
strange operations and torments among some
Jews who stole him from his parents, as the
story goes here at Trent, they murdered him at
last, and he became a saint and a martyr, to
whom much devotion is paid at this place,
though I fancy he was never heard of any
where else.</p>

<p>The river soon after we left Trent
contracted to a rapid and narrow torrent, such as
dashes at the foot of the Alps in Savoy; the
rocks grew more pointed, and the prospects
gained in sublimity at every step; though the
neatness of the culture, and quantity of vines,
with the variegated colouring of the woods,
continued to excite images more soft than
formidable, less solemn than lovely. The
barberry bushes bind every mountain round
the middle as with a scarlet sash, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
we looked down upon them from a house
situated as if in the place which the Frenchman
seemed to have a notion of, when he thought
the aerian travellers were gone <i lang="fr">au lieu ou les
vents se forment</i>, they looked wonderfully
pretty. The cleanliness and comfort with
which we are now lodged at every inn, evince
our distance from France however, and even
from Italy, where low cielings, clean windows,
and warm rooms, are deemed pernicious to
health, and destructive of true delight. Here
however we find ourselves cruelly distressed
for want of language, and must therefore
depend on our eyes only, not our ears, for
information concerning the golden house, or
more properly the golden roof, long known
to subsist at Inspruck. The story, as well as
I can gather it, is this: That some man was
reproached with spending more than he could
afford, till some of his neighbours cried out,
“Why he’ll roof his house with gold soon,
but who shall pay the expence?”&mdash;“<em>I</em> will;”
quoth the piqued German, and actually did
gild his tiles. My heart tells me however,
though my memory will not call up the particulars,
that I have heard a tale very like this
before now; but one is always listening to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
same stories I think: At Rome, when they
shew a fine head lightly sketched by Michael
Angelo, they inform you how he left it on
Raphael’s wall, after the manner of Apelles
and Protogenes; it is called Testa di Ciambellaro,
because he came disguised as a seller
of <i lang="it">ciambelle</i>, or little biscuits, while Raphael’s
scholars were painting at the Farnesini. At
Milan, when they point out to you the extraordinary
architecture of the church <i lang="it">detto il
Giardino</i>, the roof of which is supported by
geometrical dependance of one part upon
another, without columns or piers, they tell
how the architect ran away the moment it
was finished, for fear its sudden fall might
disgrace him. This tale was very familiar to
me, I had heard it long ago related of a
Welch bridge; but it is better only say what
is true.</p>

<p>This is a sweetly situated town, and a rapid
stream runs through it as at Trent; and it is
no small comfort to find one’s self once more
waited on by clean looking females, who
make your bed, sweep your room, &amp;c. while
the pewters in the little neat kitchens, as one
passes through, amaze me with their brightness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that I feel as if in a new world, it is <em>so</em>
long since I have seen any metal but gold unencrusted
by nastiness, and gold <em>will</em> not be
dirty.</p>

<p>The clumsy churches here are more violently
crowded with ornaments than I have
found them yet; and for one crucifix or
Madonna to be met with on Italian roads,
here are at least forty; an ill carved and worse
painted figure of a bleeding Saviour, large as
life, meets one at every turn; and I feel glad
when the odd devotion of the inhabitants hangs
a clean shirt or laced waistcoat over it, or both.
Another custom they have wholly new to me,
that of keeping the real skeletons of their old
nobles, or saints, or any one for whom they have
peculiar veneration, male or female, in a large
clean glass box or crystal case, placed horizontally,
and dressed in fine scarlet and gold robes,
the poor naked skull crowned with a coronet,
and the feet peeping out below the petticoats.
These melancholy objects adorn all their places
of worship, being set on brackets by the wall
inside, and remind me strangely of our old
ballad of Death and the Lady;</p>

<p>No body ever mentions that Inspruck is
subject to fires, and I wonder at it, as the roofs
are all wood cut tile-ways; and heavily pensile,
like our barns in England, for the snow to
roll off the easier.</p>

<p>Well! we are far removed indeed from
Italian architecture, Italian sculpture, and Italian
manners; but here are twenty-eight old
kings, or keysers, as our German friends call
them, large as life, and of good solid bronze,
curiously worked to imitate lace, embroidery,
&amp;c. standing in two rows, very extraordinarily,
up one of their churches. I have not seen
more frowning visages or finer dresses for a
long time; and here is a warm feel as one
passes by the houses, even in the street, from
the heat of the stoves, which most ingeniously
conceal from one’s view that most cheerful of
all sights in cold weather, a good fire. This
seems a very unnecessary device, and the heated
porcelain is apt to make one’s head ache beside;
all for the sake of this cunning contrivance,
to make one enjoy the effect of fire
without seeing the cause.</p>

<p>The women that run about the town, mean
time, take the nearest way to be warm, wrapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
themselves up in cloth clothes, like so
many fishermen at the mouth of the Humber,
and wear a sort of rug cap grossly unbecoming.
But too great an attention to convenience
disgusts as surely as too little; and while a
Venetian wench apparently seeks only to captivate
the contrary sex, these German girls
as plainly proclaim their resolution not to
sacrifice a grain of personal comfort for the
pleasure of pleasing all the men alive.</p>

<p>How truly hateful are extremes of every
thing each day’s experience convinces; from
superstition and infidelity, down to the Fribble
and the Brute, one’s heart abhors the folly of
reversing wrong to look for right, which lives
only in the middle way; and Solomon, the
wisest man of any age or nation, places the
sovereign good in mediocrity of every thing,
moral, political, and religious.</p>

<p>With this good axiom of <i lang="la">nequid nimis</i><a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in
our mouths and minds, we should not perhaps
have driven so very hard; but a less
effort would have detained us longer from the
finest object I almost ever saw; the sun rising
between six and seven o’clock upon the plains
of Munich, and discovering to our soothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sight a lovely champain country, such as might
be called a flat I fear, by those who were not
like us accustomed to a hilly one; but after
four-and-twenty hours passed among the Alps,
I feel sincerely rejoiced to quit the clouds and
get upon a level with human creatures, leaving
the goats and chamois to delight as they do
in bounding from rock to rock, with an agility
that amazes one.</p>

<p>Our weather continuing particularly fine, it
was curious to watch one picturesque beauty
changing for another as we drove along; for no
sooner were the rich vineyards and small inclosures
left behind, than large pasture lands filled
with feeding or reposing cattle, cows, oxen,
horses, fifty in a field perhaps, presented to
our eyes an object they had not contemplated
for two years before, and revived ideas of
England, which had long lain buried under
Italian fertility.</p>

<p>Instead of lying down to rest, having heard
we had friends at the same inn, we ran with
them to see the picture gallery, more for the
sake of doing again what we had once done
before at Paris with the same agreeable company,
than with any hope of entertainment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
which however upon trial was found by no
means deficient. Had there been no more
than the glow of colouring which results from
the sight of so many Flemish pictures at once,
it must have struck one forcibly; but the
murder of the Innocents by Rubens, a great
performance, gave me an opportunity of observing
the different ways by which that great
master, Guido Rheni, and Le Brun, lay hold
of the human heart. The difference does not
however appear to me inspired at all by what
we term national character; for the inhabitants
of Germany are reckoned slow to anger,
and of phlegmatic dispositions, while a Frenchman
is accounted light and airy in his ideas,
an Italian fiery and revengeful. Yet Rubens’s
principal figure follows the ruffian who has
seized her child, and with a countenance at
once exciting and expressive of horror, endeavours,
and almost arrives at tearing both
his eyes out. One actually sees the fellow
struggling between his efforts to hold the infant
fast, and yet rid himself of the mother,
while blood and anguish apparently follow the
impression her nails are making in the tenderest
parts of his face. Guido, on the contrary,
in one of the churches at Bologna, exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a beautiful young creature of no mean
rank, elegant in her affliction, and lovely in
her distress, sitting with folded arms upon the
fore-ground, contemplating the cold corpse
of her murdered baby; his nurse wringing
her hands beside them, while crowds of distracted
parents fill the perspective, and the
executioners themselves appear to pay unwilling
obedience to their inhuman king, who is
seen animating them himself from the top of
a distant tower.&mdash;Le Brun mean time, with
more imagination and sublimity than either,
makes even brute animals seem sensible, and
shudder at a scene so dreadful; while the very
horses who should bear the cruel prince over
the theatre of his crimes, snort and tremble,
and turning away with uncontrollable fury,
refuse by trampling in their blood to violate
such injured innocence!&mdash;Enough of this.</p>

<p>The patient German is seen in all they
shew us, from the painting of Brughuel to the
music of Haydn. A friend here who speaks
good Italian shewed us a collection of rarities,
among which was a picture formed of butterflies
wings; and a set of boxes one within
another, till my eyes were tired with trying to
discern, and the patience of my companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
was wearied with counting them, when the
number passed seventy-three: this amusement
has at least the grace of novelty to recommend
it. I had not formed to myself an idea of
such unmeaning, such tasteless, yet truly elaborate
nicety of workmanship, as may be
found in the Elector’s chapel, where every
relic reposes in some frame, enamelled and
adorned with a minuteness of attention and
delicacy of manual operation that astonishes.
The prodigious quantity of these gold or
ivory figures, finished so as to require a man’s
whole life to each of them, are of immense
value in their way at least, and fill one’s mind
with a sort of petty and frivolous wonder totally
unexperienced till now, bringing to one’s
recollection every hour Pope’s famous line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Lo! what huge heaps of littleness around!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The contrast between this chapel and Cappella
Borghese never left my fancy for a moment:
but if the cost of these curious trifles
caused my continued surprise, how was that
surprise increased by observing the bed-chamber
of the Elector; where they told us
that no less than one hundred thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
pounds sterling were buried under loads of
gold tissue, red velvet, and old-fashioned
carved work, without the merit even of an
attempt towards elegance or taste?</p>

<p>Nimphenbourg palace and gardens reminded
me of English gardening forty years ago,
while&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother,</div>
<div class="verse">And half the platform just reflects the other.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I do think I can recollect going with my parents
and friends to see Lord Royston’s seat at
Wrest, when we lived in Hertfordshire, in
the year 1750; and it was just such a place
as Nimphenbourg is at this day. Now for
some just praise: every thing is kept so neat
here, so clean, so sweet, so comfortably nice,
that it is a real pleasure somehow either to
go out in this town or stay at home: the
public baths are delicious; the private rooms
with boarded floors, all swept, and brushed,
and dusted, that not a cobweb can be seen in
Munich, except one kept for a rarity, with the
Virgin and Child worked in it, and wrought
to such an unrivalled pitch of delicate fineness,
that till we held it up to the light no naked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
eye could discern the figures it contained, till
a microscope soon discovered the skill and
patience requisite to its production;&mdash;great
pains indeed, and little effect! We have left
the country where things were exactly the
reverse,&mdash;great effect, and little pains! But
it is the same in every thing.</p>

<p>The women’s scrupulous attention to keep
their persons clear from dirt, makes their faces
look doubly fair; their complexions have
quite a lustre upon them, like some of our
wenches in the West of England, whose
transparent skins shew, by the motion of the
blood beneath, an illuminated countenance
that stands in the place of eye-language, and
betrays the sentiments of the innocent heart
with uncontrolable sincerity. These girls
however will not be found to attract or retain
lovers, like an Italian, whose black eyes and
white teeth (though their possessor thinks no
more of cleaning the last-named beauty than
the first) tell her mind clearly, and with little
pains again produce certain and strong effect.
Our stiff gold-stuff cap here too, as round, as
hard, and as heavy as an old Japan China
bason, and not very unlike one, is by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
means favourable to the face, as it is clapped
close round the head, the hair combed all
smooth out of sight, and a plaited border of
lace to it made firm with double-sprigged
wire; giving its wearer all the hardness and
prim look of a Quaker, without that idea of
simplicity which in their dress compensates for
the absence of every ornament.</p>

<p>The gentlemen’s <i lang="fr">maniere de s’ajuster</i> is to
me equally striking: an old nobleman who
takes delight in shewing us the glories of his
little court (where I have a notion he himself
holds some honourable office) came to dine
with us yesterday in a dressed coat of fine,
clean, white broad-cloth, laced all down with
gold, and lined with crimson sattin, of which
likewise the waistcoat was made, and laced
about with a narrower lace, but pretty broad
too; so that I thought I saw the very coat my
father went in to the old king’s birth-day
five and thirty years ago. There is more
stateliness too and ceremonious manners in the
conversation of this gentleman, and the friends
he introduced us to, than I have of late been
accustomed to; and they fatigue one with
long, dry, uninteresting narratives. The innkeepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
are honest, but inflexible; the servants
silent and sullen; the postillions slow
and inattentive; and every thing exhibits the
reverse of what we have left behind.</p>

<p>The treasures of this little Elector are prodigious,
his jewels superb; the Electress’s
pearls are superior in size and regularity to
those at Loretto, but that distinguished by the
name of the “Pearl of the Palatinate” is surely
incomparable, and, as such, always carried to
the election of a new Emperor, when each
brings his finest possession in his hand, like
the Princess of Babylon’s wooers,&mdash;which was
perhaps meant by Voltaire as a joke upon the
custom. This pearl is about the bigness and
shape of a very fine filberd, the upper part or
cap of it jet black, smooth and perfectly beautiful;
<em>it is unique in the known world</em>.</p>

<p>Our Prince’s dinner here is announced by
the sound of drums and trumpets, and he has
always a concert playing while he dines:
pomp is at this place indeed so artfully substituted
instead of general consequence, that
while one remains here one scarcely feels
aware how little any one but his own courtiers
can be thinking about the Elector of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Bavaria; but ceremony is of most use where
there is least importance, and glitter best hides
the want of solidity.</p>

<p>From Munich to Saltzbourg nothing can
exceed the beauties of the country; whole
woods, and we may say forests, of ever-green
timber, keep all idea of winter kindly at a
distance: the road lies through these elegantly-varied
thickets, which sometimes are
formed of cedars, often of foxtailed pines,
while a pale larch sometimes, and
gloomy cypress, hinder the verdure from
being too monotonous; here are likewise
mingled among them some oak and beech of
a majestic size. Nor do our prospects want
that dignity which mountains alone can bestow;
those which separate Bavaria from Hungary
are high, and of considerable extent; a
long range they are of bulky fortifications,
behind which I am informed the country is
far coarser than here.</p>

<p>The cathedral at Saltzbourg is modern,
built upon the model of St. Peter’s at Rome,
but on a small scale: one now sees how few
the defects are of that astonishing pile, though
brought close to one’s eye, by being stript of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the awful magnitude that kept examination at
a distance. The musical bells remind me of
those at Bath, and every thing here seems, as
at Bath, the work of this present century;
but there is a Benedictine convent seated on
the top of a hill above the town, of exceeding
antiquity, founded before the conquest of
England by William the Norman; under
which lie its founder and protectors, the old
Dukes of Bavaria; which they are happy to
shew travellers, with the registered account
of their young Prince <em>Adam</em>, who came over
to our island with William, and gained a settlement:
they were pleased when I proved to
them, that his blood was not yet wholly extinct
among us.</p>

<p>A fever hindered us here from looking at
the salt-works, from which the city takes its
name: but the water-works at Heelbrun
pleased us for a moment; and I never saw
beavers live so happily as with the Archbishop
of Saltzbourg, who suffers, and even encourages,
his tame ones to dig, and build,
and amuse themselves their own way: he has
fish too which eat out of his hand, and are
not carp, but I do not know what they are;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
my want of language distracts me. These
German streams appear to us particularly pellucid,
and, by what I can gather from the
people, this water never freezes. The taste of
gardening seems just what ours was in England
before Stowe was planned, and they divert
you now with puppets moved by concealed
machinery, as I recollect their doing at places
round London, called the Spaniard at Hampstead
and Don Saltero’s at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The Prince Archbishop’s income is from
three to four hundred thousand a year I understand,
and he spends it among his subjects,
who half adore him. His chief delight is in
brute animals they tell me, particularly horses,
which engross so much of his attention that he
keeps one hundred and seventeen for his own
private and personal use, of various merits,
beauties, and pedigrees; never surely was so
elegant, so capital a stud! And he is singularly
fond of a breed of fine silky-haired English
setting-dogs, red and white, and very
high upon their legs.</p>

<p>The country which carried us forward to
Vienna is eminently fine, and fine in a way
that is now once more grown new to me; no
hedges here, no small inclosures at all; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
rich land, lying like as in Dorsetshire, divided
into arable and pasture grounds, clumped
about with woods of ever-green. Such is the
genius of this sovereign for English manners
and English agriculture, that no conversation
is said to be more welcome at his court than
what relates to the sports or profits of the field
in Britain; to which accounts he listens with
good-humoured earnestness, and talks of a
fine scenting day with the true taste of an
English country gentleman.</p>

<p>On this day I first saw the Danube at Lintz,
where, though but just burst from the spring,
it is already so deep and strong that scarcely
any wooden bridge is capable to resist it, and
accordingly it did a few months ago overwhelm
many cottages and fields, among
which we passed. The inhabitants here call it
<em>Donaw</em> from its swiftness; and it deserves beside,
any name expressive of that singular purity
which distinguishes the German torrents.</p>

<p>The rivers of France, Italy, and England,
give one no idea of that elemental perfection
found in the fluids here; not a pebble, not a
fish in these translucent streams, but may be
discerned to a depth of twelve feet. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
water in Germany, so is the atmosphere in
Italy, a medium so little obstructed by vapour
I remember, that Vesuvius looked as near to
Naples, from our window, as does lord Lisburne’s
park from the little town of Exmouth
opposite, a distance of about five miles I believe,
and the other is near ten. Let me add,
that this peculiarity brings every object forward
with a certain degree of hardness not
wholly pleasing to the eye. The prospects
round Naples have another fault, resulting from
too great perfection: the sky’s brilliant uniformity,
and utter cloudlessness for many months
together, takes away those broad masses of
light and shade, with the volant shadows that
cross our British hills, relieving the sight, and
discriminating the landscape.</p>

<p>The scenery round Conway Castle in North
Wales, with a thunder-storm rolling over the
mountain; the sea strongly illuminated on
one side, with the sun shining bright upon
the verdure on the other; the lights dropping
in patches about one; exhibits a variety, the
which to equal will be very difficult, let us travel
as far as we please.</p>

<p>Magnificence of a far different kind however
claims our present attention&mdash;a convent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and church shewn us at Molcke upon our
way, the residence of eighteen friars who inhabit
a stately palace it is confessed, while three
immense courts precede your entrance to a
splendid structure of enormous size, on which
the finery bestowed amazed even me, who
came from Rome; nor had entertained an
idea of seeing such gilding, and carving, and
profusion of expence, lavished on a place of
religious retirement in our road to</p>

<hr />

<h2>VIENNA.</h2>

<p>We entered the capital by night; but I
fancied, perhaps from having been told so,
that I saw something like a look of London
round me. Apartments furnished wholly in
the Paris taste take off that look a little; so
do the public walks and drives which are formed
etoile-wise, and moving slowly up and
down the avenues, you see large stags, wild
boars, &amp;c. grazing at liberty: this is grander
than our park, and graver than the Corso.
Whenever they lay out a piece of water in this
country, it is covered as in ours with swans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
who have completely quitted the odoriferous
Po for the clear and rapid Danube.</p>

<p>Vienna was not likely to strike one with
its churches; yet the old cathedral is majestic,
and by no means stript of those ornaments
which, while one sect of Christians think it particularly
pleasing in the sight of God to retain,
is hardly warrantable in another sect,
though wiser, to be over-hasty in tearing
away. Here are however many devotional
figures and chapels left in the streets I see,
which, from the tales told in Austrian Lombardy,
one had little reason to expect; but the
emperor is tender even to the foibles of his
Viennese subjects, while he shews little feeling
to Italian misery. Men drawing carts
along the roads and street afford, indeed, somewhat
an awkward proof the government’s lenity
when human creatures are levelled with
the beasts of burden, and called <i lang="de">stott eisel</i>, or
<em>stout asses</em>, as I understand, who by this information
have learned that the frame which
supports a picture is for the same reason called
an <i lang="de">eisel</i>, as we call a thing to hang clothes on
a <em>horse</em>. It is the genius of the German language
to degrade all our English words somehow:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
they call a coach a <em>waggon</em>, and ask
a lady if she will buy pomatum to <em>smear</em> her
hair with. Such is however the resemblance
between their tongue and ours, that the Italians
protest they cannot separate either the
ideas or the words.</p>

<p>I must mention our going to the post-office
with a Venetian friend to look for letters,
where, after receiving some surly replies from
the people who attended there, our laquais
de place reminded my male companions that
they should stand <em>uncovered</em>. Finding them
however somewhat dilatory in their obedience,
a rough fellow snatched the hat from
one of their heads, saying, “<cite>Don’t you
know, Sir, that you are standing before the
emperor’s officers?</cite>”&mdash;“<cite>I know</cite>,” replied the
prompt Italian, “<cite>that we are come to a country
where people wear their hats in the church,
so need not wonder we are bid to take them
off in the post-office</cite>.” Well, where rulers are
said or supposed to be tyrannical, it is rational
that good provision should be made for arms;
otherwise despotism dwindles into nugatory
pompousness and airy show; Prospero’s empire
in the enchanted island of Shakespeare is
not more shadowy than the sight of princedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
united with impotence of power:&mdash;such
have I seen, but such is not the character of
Keysar’s dominion. The arsenal here is the
finest thing in the world I suppose; it grieved
me to feel the ideas of London and Venice
fade before it so; but the enormous size and
solidity of the quadrangle, the quantity and
disposition of the cannon, bombs, and mortars,
filled my mind with enforced respect, and
shook my nerves with the thought of what
might follow such dreadful preparation.</p>

<p>Nothing can in fact be grander than the
sight of the Austrian eagle, all made out in
arms, eight ancient heroes sternly frowning
round it. The choice has fallen on Cæsar,
Pompey, Alexander, Scipio, Hannibal, Fabius
Maximus, Cyrus, and Themistocles. I
should have thought Pyrrhus worthier the
company of all the rest than this last-named
hero; but petty criticisms are much less worthy
a place in Vienna’s arsenal, which impresses
one with a very majestic idea of Imperial
greatness.</p>

<p>On the first of November we tried at an
excursion into Hungary, where we meant to
have surveyed the Danube in all its dignity at
Presburgh, and have heard Hayden at Estherhazie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
But my being unluckily taken ill, prevented
us from prosecuting our journey further
than a wretched village, where I was
laid up with a fever, and disappointed my
company of much hoped-for entertainment.
It was curious however to find one’s self within
a few posts of the places one had read so much
of; and the words <i lang="fr">Route de Belgrade</i> upon
a finger-post gave me sensations of distance
never felt before. The comfortable sight of a
protestant chapel near me made much amends
however. The officiating priests were of the
Moravian sect it seems, and dear Mr. Hutton’s
image rushed upon my mind. A burial
passing by my windows, struck me as very
extraordinary: not one follower or even bearer
being dressed in black, but all with green
robes trimmed with dark brown furs, not
robes neither; but like long coats down to the
men’s heels, cut in skirts, and trimmed up
those skirts as well as round the bottom with
fur.</p>

<p>It was a melancholy country that we
passed through, very bleak and dismal, and I
trust would not have mended upon us had we
gone further. The few people one sees are all
ignorant, and can all speak Latin&mdash;such as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
is&mdash;very fluently. I have lived with many
very knowing people who never could speak
it with any fluency at all. Such is life!&mdash;and
such is learning! I long to talk about the
sheep and swine: they seem very worthy of
observation; the latter large and finely shaped,
of the old savage race; one fancies them like
those Eumæus tended, and perhaps they are
so; with tusks of singular beauty and whiteness,
which the uniformly brown colour of the
creature shews off to much advantage; amidst
his dark curls, waving all over his high back
and long sides, in the manner of a curl-pated
baby in England, only that the last is commonly
fair and blonde.</p>

<p>The sheep are spotted like our pigs, but
prettier; black and yellow like a tortoise-shell
cat, with horns as long as those of any he-goat
I ever saw, but very different; these
animals carrying them straight upright like an
antelope, and they are of a spiral shape. Our
mutton meantime is detestable; but here are
incomparable fish, carp large as small Severn
salmon, and they bring them to table cut in
pounds, and the joul for a handsome dish. I
only wonder one has never heard of any ancient
or any modern gluttons driving away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Presburg or Buda, for the sake of eating a
fine Danube carp.</p>

<p>With regard to men and women in Hungary,
they are not thickly scattered, but their
lamentations are loud; the emperor having
resumed all the privileges granted them by
Maria Theresa in the year 1740, or thereabouts,
when distress drove her to shelter in
that country, and has prohibited the importation
of salt herrings which used to come duty
free from Amsterdam, so that their fasts are
rendered incommodious from the asperity of
the soil, which produces very little vegetable
food.</p>

<p>Ground squirrels are frequent in the forests
here; but without Pennant’s Synopsis I never
remember the Linnæan names of quadrupeds,
so can get no information of the animal called
a glutton in English, whose skin I see in every
fur-shop, and who, I fancy, inhabits our
Hungarian woods.</p>

<p>The Imperial collection of pictures here is
really a magnificent repository of Italian taste,
Flemish colouring, and Dutch exactness: in
which the Baptist, by Giulio Romano, the
crucifixion by Vandyke, and the physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
holding up a bottle to the light by Gerard
Douw, are great examples.</p>

<p>One does not in these countries look out particularly
for the works of Roman or Bolognese
masters; but I remember a wonderful Caracci
at Munich, worthy a first place even in the
Zampieri palace; the subject, Venus sitting
under a great tree diverting herself with seeing
a scuffle between the two boys Cupid and
Anteros.</p>

<p>In the gallery here at Vienna, many of the
pictures have been handled a good deal; one
is dazzled with the brilliancy of these powerful
colourists: and here is a David Teniers
surprisingly natural, of Abraham offering up
Isaac; a glorious Pordenone representing
Santa Justina, reminded me of her fine church
at Padua, and <em>his</em> centurion at Cremona,
which I know not who could excel; and here
is Furino’s Sigismunda to be seen, the same
or a duplicate of that sold at Sir Luke
Schaub’s sale in London about thirty years
ago, and called Correggio. I have seen
it at Merriworth too, if not greatly mistaken.
The price it went for in Langford’s
auction-room I cannot surely forget,
it was three thousand pounds, <em>or they said so</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
I will only add a word of a Dutch girl representing
Herodias, and so lively in its colouring,
that I think the king would have
denied her who resembled it nothing, had he
been a native of Amsterdam. A Mount
Calvary painted by the same hand is very
striking, with a crowd of people gathered
about the cross, and men selling cakes to the
mob, as if at a fair or horse-race: two
young peasants at fisty-cuffs upon the fore
ground quarrelling, as it should seem, about
the propriety of our Saviour’s execution.</p>

<p>But I have this day heard so many and such
interesting particulars concerning the emperor,
that I should not forgive myself if I failed
to record and relate them, the less because
my authority was particularly good, and the
anecdotes singular and pleasing.</p>

<p>He rises then at five o’clock every morning,
even at this sharp season, writes in private till
nine, takes some refreshment then, and immediately
after calls his ministers, and employs
the time till one professedly in state
affairs, rides out till three, returns and studies
alone, letting the people bring his dinner at
the appointed hour, chuses out of all the
things they bring him one dish, and sets it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
on the stove to keep hot, eating it when
nature calls for food, but never detaining a
servant in the room to wait; at five he goes
to the Corridor just near his own apartment,
where poor and rich, small and great, have
access to his person at pleasure, and often get
him to arbitrate their law-suits, and decide
their domestic differences, as nothing is more
agreeable to him than finding himself considered
by his people as their father, and dispenser
of justice over all his extensive dominions.
His attention to the duties he has imposed
upon himself is so great, that, in order
to maintain a pure impartiality in his mind
towards every claimant, he suffers no man or
woman to have any influence over him, and
forbears even the slight gratification of fondling
a dog, lest it should take up too much of
his time. The emperor is a stranger upon
principle to the joys of confidence and friendship,
but cultivates the acquaintance of many
ladies and gentlemen, at whose houses (when
they see company) he drops in, and spends
the evening cheerfully in cards or conversation,
putting no man under the least restraint;
and if he sees a new comer in look disconcerted,
goes up to him and says kindly, “Divert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
yourself your own way, good Sir; and do
not let me disturb you.” His coach is like the
commonest gentleman’s of Vienna; his servants
distinguished only by the plainness of
their liveries; and, lest their insolence might
make his company troublesome to the houses
where he visits, he leaves the carriage in the
street, and will not even be driven into the
court-yard, where other equipages and footmen
wait. A large dish of hot chocolate thickened
with bread and cream is a common
afternoon’s regale here, and the emperor often
takes one, observing to the mistress of the
house how acceptable such a meal is to him
after so wretched a dinner.</p>

<p>A few mornings ago showed his character in
a strong light. Some poor women were coming
down the Danube on a float, the planks separated,
and they were in danger of drowning;
as it was very early in the day, and no one awake
upon the shore except a sawyer that was cutting
wood; who, not being able to obtain
from his phlegmatic neighbours that assistance
their case immediately required, ran directly
to call the emperor who he knew would be
stirring, and who came flying to give that
help which from some happy accident was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
longer wanted: but Joseph lost no good humour
on the occasion; on the contrary, he congratulated
the women on their deliverance,
praising at the same time and rewarding the
fellow for having disturbed him.</p>

<p>My informer told me likewise, that if two
men dispute about any matter till mischief is
expected, the wife of one of them will often
cry out, “Come, have done, have done directly,
or I’ll call our master, and he’ll make you have
done.” Now is it fair not to do every thing but
adore a sovereign like this? when we know that
if such tales were told us of Marcus Aurelius, or
Titus Vespasian, it would be our delight to repeat,
our favourite learning to read of them. Such
conduct would serve succeeding princes for
models, nor could the weight of a dozen
centuries smother their still rising fame. Yet
is not my heart persuaded that the reputation
of Joseph the Second will be consigned immaculate
from age to age, like that of these
immortal worthies, though dearly purchased
by the loss of ease and pleasure; while neither
the mitred prelate nor the blameless puritan
pursue with blessings a heart unawed by splendour,
unsoftened by simplicity; a hand
stretched forth rather to dispense justice, than
opening spontaneously to distribute charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
To speak less solemnly, if men were nearer
than they are to perfect creatures, absolute
monarchy would be the most perfect form of
government, for the will of the prince could
never deviate from propriety; but if one king
can see all with his own eyes, and hear all
with his own ears, no successor will ever be
able to do the same; and it is like giving
Harrison 10,000 l. for finding the longitude,
to commend a person for having hit on the
right way of governing a great nation, while
his science is incommunicable, and his powers
of execution must end with his life.</p>

<p>The society here is charming; Sherlock
says, that he who does not like Vienna is his
own satirist; I shall leave others to be mine.
The ladies here seem very highly accomplished,
and speak a great variety of languages with
facility, studying to adorn the conversation
with every ornament that literature can bestow;
nor do they appear terrified as in London,
lest pedantry should be imputed to them,
for venturing sometimes to use in company
that knowledge they have acquired in private
by diligent application. Here also are
to be seen young unmarried women once
again: misses, who wink at each other, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
titter in corners at what is passing in the
rooms, public or private: I had lived so long
away from <em>them</em>, that I had half forgotten
their existence.</p>

<p>The horses here are trimmed at the heels,
and led about in body clothes like ours in
England; but their drawing is ill managed, no
shafts somehow but a pole, which, when there
is one horse only, looks awkward and badly
contrived. Beasts of various kinds plowing together
has a strange look, and the ox harnessed
up like a hunter in a phaeton cuts a
comical figure enough. One need no longer say,
<i lang="la">Optat ephippia bos piger</i><a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; but it is very silly,
as no use can be thus made of that strength
which lies only in his head and horns.
Plenty of wood makes the Germans profusely
elegant in their pales, hurdles, &amp;c. which
give an air of comfort and opulence, and
make the best compensation a cold climate can
make for the hedges of jessamine and medlar
flowers, which I shall see no more.</p>

<p>Our architecture here can hardly be expected
to please an eye made fastidious from the
contemplation of Michael Angelo’s works at
Rome, or Palladio’s at Venice; nor will German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
music much delight those who have been
long accustomed to more simple melody,
though intrinsic merit and complicated excellence
will always deserve the highest note of
praise. Whoever takes upon him to under-rate
that which no one can obtain without infinite
labour and study, will ever be censured, and
justly, for refusing the reward due to deep
research; but if a man’s taste leads him to like
<em>Cyprus</em> wine, let him drink <em>that</em>, and content
himself with commending the <em>old hock</em>.</p>

<p>Apropos, we hear that <em>Sacchini</em>, the Metastasio
of musical composers, is dead; but nobody at
Vienna cares about his compositions. Our
Italian friends are more candid; they are
always talking in favour of Bach and Brughuel,
Handel and Rubens.</p>

<p>The cabinet of natural history is exceedingly
fine, and the rooms singularly well disposed.
There are more cameos at Bologna,
and one superior specimen of native gold:
every thing else I believe is better here, and
such opals did I never see before, no not at
Loretto: the petrified lemon and artichoke
have no equals, and a brown diamond
was new to me to-day. A specimen of sea-salt
filled with air bubbles like the rings one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
buys at Vicenza, is worth going a long way
to look at; but the gentleman at Munich,
who shewed us the Virgin Mary in a cobweb,
had a piece of red silver shot out into a ruby
like crystal, more extraordinary than any mineral
production I have seen. Our attention
was caught by Maria Theresa’s bouquet, but
one cannot forget the pearls belonging to the
electress of Bavaria.</p>

<p>What seemed, however, most to charm the
people who shewed the cabinet, was a snuff-box
consisting of various gems, none bigger
than a barley-corn, each of prodigious value,
and the workmanship of more, every square
being inlaid so neatly, and no precious stone
repeated, though the number is no less than
one hundred and eighty-three; a false bottom
besides of gold, opening with a spring touch,
and discovering a written catalogue of the
jewels in the finest hand-writing, and the smallest
possible. This was to me a real curiosity,
afforded a new and singular proof of that
astonishing power of eye, and delicacy of
manual operation, seconded by a patient and
persevering attention to things frivolous in
themselves, which will be for ever alike neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
by the fire of Italian genius, and disdained
by the dignity of British science.</p>

<p>We have seen other sort of things to-day
however. The Hungarian and Bohemian
robes pleased me best, and the wild unset
jewels in the diadem of Transylvania impressed
me with a valuable idea of Gothic
greatness. The service of gold plate too is
very grand from its old-fashioned solidity. I
liked it better than I did the snuff-box; and
here is a dish in ivory puts one in mind of nothing
but Achilles’s shield, so worked is its broad
margin with miniature representations of battles,
landscapes, &amp;c. three dozen different stories
round the dish, one might have looked at it
with microscopes for a week together. The
porcelane plates have been painted to ridicule
Raphael’s pots at Loretto I fancy; Julio Romano’s
manner is comically parodied upon
one of them.</p>

<p>Prince Lichtenstein’s pictures are charming;
a Salmacis in the water by Albano is
the best work of that master I ever saw,
not diffused as his works commonly are, but
all collected somehow, and fine in a way I
cannot express for want of more knowledge;
<em>very, very</em> fine it is however, and full of expression
and character. The Caracci school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
again.&mdash;Here is the whole history of Decius
by Rubens too, wonderfully learned; and an
assumption of the Virgin so like Mrs. Pritchard
our famous actress, no portrait ever represented
her so well. A St. Sebastian divinely
beautiful, by Vandyke; and a girl playing on
the guitar, which you may run round almost,
by the coarse but natural hand of Caravagio.</p>

<p>The library is new and splendid, and they
buy books for it very liberally. The learned
and amiable Abbé Denys shewed me a thousand
unmerited civilities, was charmed with
the character of Dr. Johnson, and delighted
with the story of his conversation at Rouen
with Mons. l’Abbé Rossette. This gentleman
seems to love England very much, and
English literature; spoke of Humphry Prideaux
with respect, and has his head full of
Ossian’s poetry, of which he can repeat whole
pages. He shewed me a fragment of Livy
written in the fifth century, a psalter and
creed beautifully illuminated of the year
nine hundred, and a large portion of St.
Mark’s gospel on blue paper of the year three
hundred and seven. A Bibbia de Poveri too,
as the Italians call it, curious enough; the
figures all engraved on wood, and only a text
at bottom to explain them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Winceslaus marked every book he ever possessed,
it seems, with the five vowels on the back;
and almost every one with some little miniature
made by himself, recording his escape from
confinement at Prague in Bohemia, where the
washer-woman having assisted him to get out
of prison under pretence of bathing, he has been
very studious to register the event; so much
so that even on the margins of his bible he
has been tempted to paint past scenes that
had better have been blotted from his memory.</p>

<p>The Livy which learned men have hoped
to find safe in the seraglio of Constantinople,
was burned by their late sultan Amurath, our
Abbé Denys tells me; the motive sprung from
mistaken piety, but the effect is to be lamented.
He shewed me an Alcoran in extremely small
characters, surprisingly so indeed, taken out
of a Turkish officer’s pocket when John Sobiesky
raised the siege of this city in the year
1590, and a preacher took for his text the
Sunday after, “<cite>There was a man sent from
God whose name was <em class="antiqua">John</em>.</cite>” I was much
amused with a sight of the Mexican MSS and
Peruvian quipos; nor are the Turkish figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of Adam and Eve, our Saviour and his mother,
less remarkable; but Mahomet surrounded
by a glory about his head, a veil concealing
his face as too bright for inspection, exceeded
all the rest.</p>

<p>Here are many ladies of fashion in this
town very eminent for their musical abilities,
particularly Mesdemoiselles de Martinas, one of
whom is member of the Academies of Berlin
and Bologna: the celebrated Metastasio died in
their house, after having lived with the family
sixty-five years more or less. They set his poetry
and sing it very finely, appearing to recollect
his conversation and friendship, with infinite
tenderness and delight. He was to have been
presented to the Pope the very day he died,
I understand, and in the delirium which immediately
preceded dissolution he raved much
of the supposed interview. Unwilling to hear
of death, no one was ever permitted even to
mention it before him; and nothing put him
so certainly out of humour, as finding that
rule transgressed even by his nearest friends.
Even the small-pox was not to be named in
his presence, and whoever <em>did</em> name that disorder,
though unconscious of the offence he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
had given, Metastasio would see him no more.
The other peculiarities I could gather from
Miss Martinas were these: That he had contentedly
lived half a century at Vienna, without
ever even wishing to learn its language; that he
had never given more than five guineas English
money in all that time to the poor; that he
always sat in the same seat at church, but never
paid for it, and that nobody dared ask
him for the trifling sum; that he was grateful
and beneficent to the friends who began
by being his protectors, but ended much his
debtors, for solid benefits as well as for elegant
presents, which it was his delight to be perpetually
making them, leaving to them at last
all he had ever gained without the charge
even of a single legacy; observing in his will
that it was to them he owed it, and other
conduct would in him have been injustice.
Such were the sentiments, and such the conduct
of this great poet, of whom it is of little
consequence to tell, that he never changed the
fashion of his wig, the cut or colour of his
coat, so that his portrait taken not very long
ago looks like those of Boileau or Moliere
at the head of their works. His life was
arranged with such methodical exactness, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
he rose, studied, chatted, slept, and dined at the
same hours for fifty years together, enjoying
uninterrupted health, which probably gave him
that happy sweetness of temper, or habitual gentleness
of manners, which never suffered itself
to be ruffled, but when his sole injunction was
forgotten, and the death of any person whatever
was unwittingly mentioned before him. No
solicitation had ever prevailed on him to dine
from home, nor had his nearest intimates ever
seen him <em>eat</em> more than a biscuit with his lemonade,
every meal being performed with
even mysterious privacy to the last. When
his end approached by steps so very rapid, he
did not in the least suspect that it was coming;
and Mademoiselle Martinas has scarcely yet
done rejoicing in the thought that he escaped
the preparations he so dreaded. His early
passion for a celebrated singer is well known
upon the continent; since that affair finished,
all his pleasures have been confined to music
and conversation. He had the satisfaction of
seeing the seventieth edition of his works I
think they said, but am ashamed to copy out
the number from my own notes, it seems so
<em>very</em> strange; and the delight he took in
hearing the lady he lived with sing his songs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
was visible to every one. An Italian Abate
here said, comically enough, “Oh! he looked
like a man in the state of beatification always
when Mademoiselle de Martinas accompanied
his verses with her fine voice and brilliant
finger.” The father of Metastasio was a goldsmith
at Rome, but his son had so devoted
himself to the family he lived with, that he
refused to hear, and took pains not to know,
whether he had in his latter days any one
relation left in the world. On a character so
singular I leave my readers to make their own
<em>observations and reflections</em>.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Au reste</i>, as the French say; I have no notion
that Vienna, <i lang="it">sempre ventoso o velenoso</i><a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>,
can be a very wholesome place to live in; the
double windows, double feather-beds, &amp;c. in
a room without a chimney, is surely ill contrived;
and sleeping smothered up in down so,
like a hydrophobous patient in some parts of
Ireland, is not <em>particularly</em> agreeable, though
I begin to like it better than I did. All external
air is shut out in such a manner that I
am frighted lest, after a certain time, the room
should become like an exhausted receiver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
while the wind whirls one about the street in
such a manner that it is displeasing to put out
one’s head; and a physician from Ragusa
settled here told me, that wounded lungs are
a common consequence of the triturated stone
blown about here; and in fact asthmas and
consumptions are their reigning diseases.</p>

<p>Apropos, the plague is now raging in Transylvania;
how little safe should we think ourselves
at London, were a disorder so contagious
known to be no farther distant than Derby?
The distance is scarcely greater now from Vienna
to the place of distress; yet I will not say we
are in much danger to be sure, for that perpetual
connection kept up between all the
towns and counties of Great Britain is unknown
in other nations, and we should be as
many days going to Transylvania from here
perhaps, as we should be <em>hours</em> running from
Toddenham-court road to Derby.</p>

<p>Sheenburn is pretty, but it is no season for seeing
pretty places. The streets of Vienna are not
pretty at all, God knows; so narrow, so ill built,
so crowded, many wares placed upon the ground
where there is a little opening, seems a strange
awkward disposition of things for sale; and the
people cutting wood in the street makes one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
half wild when walking; it is hardly possible
to pass another strange custom, borrowed from
Italy I trust, of shutting up their shops in the
middle of the day; it must tend, one would
think, but little to the promotion of that commerce
which the sovereign professes to encourage,
and I see no excuse for it <em>here</em> which
can be made from heat, gaiety, or devotion.
Many families living in the same house, and
at the entrance of the apartments belonging
to each, a strong iron gate to separate the
residence of one set from that of another, has
likewise an odd melancholy look, like that of
a prison or a nunnery. Nunneries, however,
here are none; and if the old women turned
out of those they have long dwelt in, are not
provided with decent pensions, it must surely
distress even the Emperor’s cold heart to see age
driven from the refuges of disappointment,
and forced to wander through the world with
inexperience for its guide, while youth is no
longer <em>led</em>, but <em>thrust</em> into temptation by such
a sudden transition from utter retirement to
open and busy life.</p>

<p>We have been this morning to look over
his academy of painting, &amp;c. His exhibition-room
is neatly kept, and I dare say will prosper:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the students are zealous and laborious,
and earnestly desire the promulgation of
science: their collection of models is meagre,
but it will mend by degrees. Perhaps Joseph
the IId. is the first European sovereign who,
establishing a school for painting and sculpture,
has insisted on the artists never exercising
their skill upon any subject which could
hurt any person’s delicacy;&mdash;an example well
worthy honest praise and speedy imitation.</p>

<p>The very few charitable foundations established
at Vienna by Imperial munificence are
well managed; their paucity is accounted for
by the recollection of many abuses consequent
on the late Empress’s bounty; her son therefore
took all the annuities away, which he
thought her tenderness had been duped out
of; but let it be remembered that when he
rides or walks in a morning, he always takes
with him a hundred ducats, out of which he
never brings any home, but gives in private
donations what he knows to be well bestowed,
without the ostentation of affected generosity:
it is not in rewards for past services
perhaps, nor in public and stately institutions,
as I am told here, that this prince’s liberalities
are to be looked for; yet&mdash;</p>

<p>To-morrow (23d of November) we venture
to leave Vienna and proceed northwards, as
I long to see the Dresden gallery. Here
every thing appears to me a caricatura of
London; the language like ours, but coarser;
the plays like ours, but duller; the streets at
night lighted up, not like ours now, but very
like what they were thirty or forty years
ago.</p>

<p>Among the people I have seen here, Mademoiselle
Paradies, the blind performer on
the harpsichord, interested me very much;&mdash;and
she liked England so, and the King
and Queen were so kind to her, and she was
<em>so</em> happy, she said!&mdash;While life and its vexations
seem to oppress such numbers of hearts,
and cloud such variety of otherwise agreeable
faces, one must go to a blind girl to hear of
happiness, it seems! But she has wonderful
talents for languages as well as music, and has
learned the English pronunciation most surprisingly.
It is a soothing sight when one
finds the mind compensate for the body’s defects:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
I took great delight in the conversation
of Mademoiselle Paradies.</p>

<p>The collection of rarities, particularly an
Alexander’s head worthy of Capo di Monte,
now in the possession of Madame de Hesse, became
daily more my study, as I received more
and more civilities from the charming family
at whose house it resides: there are some very
fine cameos in it, and a great variety of miscellaneous
curiosities.</p>

<p>So different are the customs here and at
Venice, that the German ladies offer you
chocolate on the same salver with coffee, of an
evening, and fill up both with milk; saying
that you may have the latter quite black if
you chuse it&mdash;“<i lang="fr">Tout noir, Monsieur, à la Venetienne</i>;”&mdash;adding
their best advice not to risque
a practice so unwholesome. While their care
upon that account reminds me chiefly of a
friend, who lives upon the Grand Canal, that
in reply to a long panegyric upon English delicacy,
said she would tell a story that would
prove them to be nasty enough, at least in
some things; for that she had actually seen a
handsome young nobleman, who came from
London (<em>and ought to have known better</em>),
souce some thick cream into the fine clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
coffee she presented him with; which every
body must confess to be <i lang="it">vera porcheria</i>!
a very <em>piggish trick</em>!&mdash;So necessary and so
pleasing is conformity, and so absurd and perverse
is it ever to forbear such assimilation of
manners, when not inconsistent with the
virtue, honour, or necessary interest:&mdash;let us
eat sour-crout in Germany, frittura at Milan,
macaroni at Naples, and beef-steaks in England,
if one wishes to please the inhabitants
of either country; and all are very good, so it
is a slight compliance. Poor Dr. Goldsmith
said once&mdash;“I would advise every young fellow
setting out in life <em>to love gravy</em>;”&mdash;and
added, that he had formerly seen a glutton’s
eldest nephew disinherited, because his uncle
never could persuade him to say he liked
gravy.</p>

<h2>PRAGUE.</h2>

<p>The inns between Vienna and this place
are very bad; but we arrived here safe the
24th of November, when I looked for little
comfort but much diversion; things turned
out however exactly the reverse, and <i lang="fr">aux
bains de Prague</i> in Bohemia we found beds
more elegant, dinners neater dressed, apartments
cleaner and with a less foreign aspect,
than almost any where else. Such is not
mean time the general appearance of the town
out of doors, which is savage enough; and
the celebrated bridge singularly ugly I think,
crowded with vast groupes of ill-made statues,
and heavy to excess, though not incommodious
to drive over, and of a surprising
extent. These German rivers are magnificent,
and our Mulda here (which is but a
branch of the Elbe neither) is respectable for
its volume of water, useful for the fish contained
in it, and lovely in the windings of its
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Bohemia seems no badly-cultivated country;
the ground undulates like many parts of
Hertfordshire, and the property seems divided
much in the same manner as about Dunstable;
my head ran upon Lilly-hoo, when they
shewed me the plains of Kolin.</p>

<p>Doctor Johnson was very angry with a
gentleman at our house once, I well remember,
for not being better company; and urged
that he had travelled into Bohemia, and seen
Prague:&mdash;“Surely,” added he, “the man
who has seen Prague might tell us something
new and something strange, and not sit silent
for want of matter to put his lips in motion!”
<i lang="la">Horresco referens</i>;&mdash;I have now been at
Prague as well as Doctor Fitzpatrick, but have
brought away nothing very interesting I fear;
unless that the floor of the opera-stage there is
inlaid, which so far as I have observed is a <em>new</em>
thing; the cathedral I am sure is an <em>old</em>
thing, and charged with heavy and ill-chosen
ornaments, worthy of the age in which it was
fabricated!&mdash;One would be loth to see any
alteration take place, or any picture drive old
Frank’s Three Kings, divided into three compartments,
from its station over the high altar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
St. John Neppomucene has an altar here all
of solid silver, very bright and clean; his
having been flung into the river Mulda in
the persecuting days, holding fast his crucifix
and his religion, gives him a rational title to
veneration among the martyrs, and he is
considered as the tutelar saint here, where his
statue meets one at the entrance of every
town.</p>

<p>This truly Gothic edifice was very near
being destroyed by the King of Prussia, who
bombarded the city thirty-five years ago; I
saw the mark made by one ball just at the
cathedral door, and heard with horror of the
dreadful siege, when an egg was sold for a
florin, and other eatables in proportion: the
whole town has, in consequence of that long
blockade, a ragged and half-ruined melancholy
aspect; and the roads round it, then
broken up, have scarcely been mended since.</p>

<p>The ladies too looked more like masquerading
figures than any thing else, as they sat
in their boxes at the opera, with rich embroidered
caps, or bright pink and blue sattin
head-dresses, with ermine or sable fronts, a
heavy gold tassel hanging low down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
left ear, and no powder; which gives a girlish
look, and reminded me of a fashion our lower
tradesmen in London had about fifteen or
eighteen years ago, of dressing their daughters,
from nine to twelve years old, in puffed
black sattin caps, with a long ear hanging
down on one side. It is a becoming mode
enough as the women wear it here, but gives
no idea of cleanliness; and I suppose that
whilst finery retains its power of striking, delicacy
keeps her distance, nor attempts to
come in play till the other has failed of its
effect. Ladies dress here very richly, as indeed
I expected to find them, and coloured
silk stockings are worn as they were in England
till the days of the Spectator:&mdash;“<cite>Thrift,
thrift, Horatio</cite>;” as Hamlet observes; for our
expences in Great Britain are infinitely increased
by our advancement from splendor to
neatness.</p>

<p>Here every thing seems at least five centuries
behind-hand, and religion has not purified
itself the least in the world since the
days of its early struggle; for here Huss
preached, and here Jerome, known by the
name of Jerome of Prague, first began to
project the scheme of a future reformation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
The Bohemians had indeed been long before
that time indulged by the Popes with permission
to receive the cup in the sacrament, a favour
granted no one else; and of that no notice
was ever taken, till further steps were
made for the obtaining many alterations that
have crept in since that time in other nations,
not so hasty to do by violence what will one
day be done of themselves without any violence
at all.</p>

<p>I asked to see some Protestant meeting-houses,
and was introduced to a very pleasing-mannered
Livornese, who spoke sweet Italian,
and was minister to a little place of worship
which could not have contained two hundred
people at the most; in fact his flock were all
soldiers, he said. Not a person who could
keep a shop was to be found of <em>our</em> persuasion,
nor was Lutheranism half so much detested
even in Italy, he said. Though I remember
the boys hooting us at Tivoli too, and calling
our English Gentlemen, <em>Monsieur Dannato</em>.</p>

<p>The library does not seem ancient, but the
grave person who shewed it spoke very indifferent
French, so that I could better trust my
eyes than my ears; this want of language is
terrible!&mdash;A celestial globe moving by clockwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
concealed within, and shewing the
sun’s place upon the ecliptic very exactly,
detained our attention agreeably; and I observed
a polyglot Bible printed at London in
Cromwell’s time, with a compliment to him
in the preface, which they have expunged in
succeeding editions. A missal too was curious
enough from its being decorated with some
singular illuminations upon one leaf; at the
top of the page a figure of Wickliffe is seen,
striking the flint and steel; under him, in another
small compartment, Jerome of Prague
blowing tinder to make his torch kindle;
below him again down the same side, Martin
Luther, the flambeau well lighted and blazing
in his hand; at the bottom of the page poor
John Huss, betrayed by the Emperor who
promised him protection, and burning alive at
a stake, to the apparent satisfaction of the
charitable fathers assembled at the council of
Constance. Another curiosity should be remembered;
the manuscript letter from Zisca,
the famous Protestant general who headed the
revolters in 1420; I was amazed to see in
how elegant an Italian hand it was written;
the librarian said comically enough&mdash;“<cite>Ay, ay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
it begins all about the fear of God, <span class="antiqua">&amp;c.;</span> those
fellows</cite>,” continued he, “<cite>you know, are always
sure to be canters!</cite>”</p>

<p>The reigning sovereign has made few
changes in church matters here, except that
which was become almost indispensable, the
resolution to have mass said only at one altar,
instead of many at a time; the contrary
practice does certainly disturb devotion, and
produce unavoidable indecorums, as no one
can tell what he turns his back upon, while
the bell rings in so many places of a large
church at once, and so many different functions
are going forward, that people’s attention
must almost necessarily be distracted.</p>

<p>The eating here is incomparable; I never
saw such poultry even at London or Bath,
and there is a plenty of game that amazes
one; no inn so wretched but you have a
pheasant for your supper, and often partridge
soup. The fish is carried about the streets in
so elegant a style it tempts one; a very large
round bathing-tub, as we should call it, set
barrow-wise on two not very low wheels, is
easily pushed along by one man, though full
of the most pellucid water, in which the carp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
tench, and eels, are all leaping alive, to a size
and perfection I am ashamed to relate; but
the tench of four and five pounds weight have
a richness and flavour one had no notion of
till we arrived at Vienna, and they are the
same here.</p>

<p>How trade stands or moves in these countries
I cannot tell; there is great rigour shewn
at the custom-house; but till the shopkeepers
learn to keep their doors open at least for the
whole of the short days, not shut them up so
and go to sleep at one or two o’clock for a
couple of hours, I think they do not deserve
to be disturbed by customers who bring ready
money. To-morrow (30th November 1786)
we set out, wrapped in good furs and flannels,
for</p>

<p class="noindent">As the ingenious Soame Jenyns says of a less
hazardous drive in a less barbarous country I
hope: but really to English passengers in
English carriages, the road from Prague hither
is too bad to think on; while nothing literally
impels one forward except the impossibility of
going back. Lady Mary Wortley says, her
husband and postillions slept upon the precipices
between Lowositz and Aussig; but
surely the way must have been much better
then, as all the opium in both would scarce
have stupefied their apprehensions now, when
a fall into the Elbe must either have interrupted
or finished their nap; because our
coach was held up every step of the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
by men’s hands, while we walked at the bottom
about seven miles by the river’s side, suffering
nothing but a little fatigue, and enjoying
the most cloudless beautiful weather ever
seen. The Elbe is here as wide I think as
the Severn at Gloucester, and rolls through
the most varied and elegant landscape possible,
not inferior to that which adorns the sides of
the little Dart in Devonshire, but on a greater
scale; every hill crowned with some wood,
or ornamented by some castle.</p>

<p>As soon as we arrived, tired and hungry, at
Aussig, we put our shattered coach on board
a bark, and floated her down to Dresden;
whither we drove forward in the little carts
of the country, called chaises, but very rough
and with no springs, as our very old-fashioned
curricles were about the year 1750. The
brightness of the weather made even such a
drive delightful though, and the millions of
geese on and off the river gave animation to
the views, and accounted for the frequency of
those soft downy feather-beds, which sooth
our cares and relieve our fatigue so comfortably
every night. Hares will scarce move
from near the carriage wheels, so little apprehensive
are they of offence; and the partridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
run before one so, it is quite amusing to look
at them. The trout in these great rivers are
neither large nor red: I have never seen trout
worth catching since I left England; the river
at Rickmansworth produces (one should like
to know why) that fish in far higher perfection
than it can be found in any other stream
perhaps in Europe.</p>

<p>The being served at every inn, since we
came into Saxony, upon Dresden china, gives
one an odd feel somehow; but here at the
Hôtel de Pologne there is every thing one can
wish, and served in so grand a style, that I
question whether any English inn or tavern
can compare with it; so elegantly fine is the
linen, so beautiful the porcelaine of which
every the meanest utensil is made; and if the
waiter did not appear before one dressed like
Abel Drugger with a green cloth apron, and
did not his entrance always fill the room with
a strong scent of tobacco, I should think myself
at home again almost. This really does
seem a very charming town; the streets well
built and spacious; the shops full of goods,
and the people willing to shew them; and if
they <em>do</em> cut all their wood before their own
doors, why there is room to pass here without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
brawling and bones-breaking, which disgusts
one so at Vienna; it seems lighter too here
than there; I cannot tell why, but every
thing looks clean and comfortable, and one
feels <em>so much at home</em>. I hate prejudice; nothing
is so stupid, nothing so sure a mark of a
narrow mind: yet who can be sure that the
sight of a Lutheran town does not afford in
itself an honest pleasure to one who has lived
so long, though very happily, under my Lord
Peter’s protection?</p>

<p>Here Brother Martin has all precedence
paid <em>him</em>; for though the court are Romanists,
their splendid church here is <em>called</em>
only a chapel, and they are not permitted to
ring the bell, a privilege the Lutherans seem
much attached to, for nothing can equal the
noise of <em>our</em> bells on a Sunday morning at
Dresden.</p>

<p>The architecture is truly hideous, but no
ornaments are spared; and the church of
Notre Dame here is very magnificent. The
china steeples all over the country are the
oddest things in the world; spires of blue
or green porcelaine tiles glittering in the sun
have a strange effect. But nothing can afford
a stronger proof that crucifixes, Madonnas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
and saints, need not be driven out of churches
for fear they should be worshipped, than the
Lutherans admission of them into <em>theirs</em>; for
no people can be further removed from idolatry,
or better instructed in the Christian religion,
than the common people of this town;
where a decent observation of the sabbath
struck me with most consolatory feelings, after
living at Paris, Rome, and Florence, where
it is considered as a <em>merry</em>, not a <em>holy</em> day at
all! and though there seems nothing inconsistent
or offensive in our rejoicing on the day
of our Lord’s resurrection, yet if people are
encouraged to <em>play</em>, they will soon find out
that they may <em>work</em> too, the shops will scarcely
be shut, and all appearance of regard to the
fourth commandment will be done away.
The Lutherans really seem to observe the
golden mean; they frequent their churches
all morning with a rigorous solemnity, no
carts or business of any sort goes forward in
the streets, public and private devotion takes
up the whole forenoon; but they do not forbear
to meet and dance after six o’clock in
the evening, or play a sober game for small
sums at a friend’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>The society is to me very delightful; more
women than men though, and the women
most agreeable; exceedingly sensible, well informed,
and willing to talk on every subject
of general importance, but religion or politics
seem the favourite themes, and are I believe
most studied here;&mdash;no wonder, the court and
city being of different sects, each steadily and
irrevocably fixed in a firm persuasion that
their own is best, causes an investigation that
comes not in the head of people of other
countries; and it is wonderful to see even the
low Romanists skilled in controversial points
to a degree that would astonish the people
nearest the Pope’s person, I am well persuaded.</p>

<p>The Saxons are excessively loyal however,
and have the sense to love and honour their
sovereign no less for his difference of opinion
from theirs, than if all were of one mind;
yet knowing his principles, they watch with a
jealous eye against encroachments, while the
amiable elector and electress use every tender
method to induce their subjects to embrace
<em>their</em> tenets, and weary heaven with prayers
for their conversion, as if the people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
heathens. One great advantage results from
this odd mixture of what so steadily resists
uniting; it is the earnest desire each has to
justify and recommend their notions by their
practice, so that the inhabitants of Dresden
are among the most moral, decent, thinking
people I have seen in my travels, or indeed
in my life. The general air and manner both
of place and people, puts one in mind of the
pretty clean parts of our London, about Queen
Square, Ormond Street, Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields,
and Southampton Row.</p>

<p>The bridge is beautiful, more elegant than
showy; the light iron railing is better in
some respects than a stone balustrade, and I
do not dislike the rule they make to themselves
of going on <em>one</em> side the way always,
and returning the other, to avoid a crowd and
confusion.</p>

<p>But it is time to talk about the picture
gallery, where, cold as our weather is, I contrive
to pass three hours every day, my feet
well defended by <i lang="fr">perlaches</i>, a sort of cloth
clogs, very useful and commodious. And
now I have seen the <i lang="it">Notte di Corregio</i> from
which almost all pictures of <em>effect</em> have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
their original idea; and here are three other
Corregios inimitable, invaluable, incomparable.
Surely this <i lang="it">Notte</i> might stand side by
side with Raphael’s Transfiguration; and as
Sherlock says that Shakespear and Corneille
would look only on the Vesuvius side of the
prospect at Naples, while Pope and Racine
would turn their heads towards Posilippo;
so probably, while the two first would fasten
all their attention upon the Demoniac, the
two last would console their eyes with the
sweetness of Corregio’s Nativity. His little
Magdalen too set round with jewels, itself
more precious than any or than all of them,
possesses wonderful powers of attraction; it is
an hour before one can recollect that there are
some glorious Titians in the same façade; but
Caracci, who depends not on his colouring for
applause, loses little by their vicinity, and
Poussin is always equally respectable. The
Rembrandts are beyond credibility perfect of
their kind, and produce a most powerful effect.
His portrait of his own daughter has
neither equal nor price, I believe; though the
girl has little dignity to be sure, and less grace
about her; but if to represent nature as she <em>is</em>
suffices, this is the first single figure in Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
as painting a <em>live woman</em>.&mdash;The Jupiter and
Ganymede is very droll indeed, and done
with very <em>un</em>-Italian notions; but the eagle
looks as if one might pluck his feathers; it
is very life itself.&mdash;A candle-light Rubens here
is shewn as a prodigious rarity; a Ruysdael
as much resembling nature in <em>his</em> country, I
do believe, as Claude Lorraine ever painted
in <em>his</em>.&mdash;The crayons Cupid of Mengs which
dazzles, and the portrait of old Parr by Vandycke
which interests one, are pictures which
call one to look at them again and again; and
the little Vanderwerfs kept in glass cases,
smooth as ivory, and finished to perfection,
are all alike to be sure; one would wonder
that a man should never be weary of painting
single figures so, and constantly repeating the
same idea; his eyes must have had peculiar
strength too, to endure such trials, mine have
been pained enough this morning with only
looking at his labours, and those of the indefatigable
Denny. Let me refresh them
with a Parnassus of Giacomo Tintoret, who
puts all the colourists to flight except Corregio.</p>

<p>But here are two pictures which display
prodigious genius, by a master of whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
never heard any one speak, Ferdinand Bol,
who unites grace and dignity to the clear obscure
of Rembrandt, whose scholar he was.
Jacob blessing Pharoah, painted by him, is
delightful; and Joseph’s expressions while he
presents his father, full of affectionate partiality
and fond regard for the old man, heightens
his personal beauty; while the king’s character
is happily managed too, and gives one
the highest idea of the artist’s skill. A Madonna
reposing in her flight to Egypt with a
fatigued look, her head supported by her
hand, is elegant, and worthy of the Roman
or Bolognese schools; the landscape is like
Rembrandt. This gallery boasts an Egyptian
Mary by Spagnolet, too terrifying to look long
at; and a small picture by Lodovico Carracci
of the Virgin clasping her Son, who lies asleep
in her lap, while a vision of his future crucifixion
shewn her by angels in the sky,
agitates every charming feature of her face,
and causes a shrinking in her figure which
no power of art can exceed.</p>

<p>As I suffered so much for the sake of seeing
this collection, I have indulged myself too long
in talking of it perhaps; but Garrick is dead,
and Siddons at a distance, and some compensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
must be had; can any thing afford it
except the statues of Rome, and the pictures
of Bologna? here are a vast many from thence
in this magnificent gallery.</p>

<p>We had a concert made on purpose for us
last night by some amiable friends: it was a
very good one. What I liked best though,
was Mr. Tricklir’s new invention of keeping
a harpsichord always in tune; and it seems to
answer. I am no good mechanic, nor particularly
fond of multiplying combinations;
but the device of adding a thermometer to
shew how much heat the strings will bear without
relaxation seems ingenious enough:
we had a vast many experiments made, and
nobody could put the strings out of tune, or
even break them, when his method was
adopted; and it does not take up two minutes
in the operation.</p>

<p>We have seen the Elector’s treasures; and,
as a Frenchman would express it, <i lang="fr">C’est icy
qu’on voit des beaux diamants!</i><a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The yellow
brilliant ring is <em>unique</em> it seems, and valued
at an enormous sum; the green one is larger,
and set transparent; it is not green like an
emerald, but pale and bright, and beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
conception beautiful: hyacinths were new
to me here, their glorious colour dazzles one;
and here is a white diamond from the Great
Mogul’s empire, of unequalled perfection;
besides an onyx large as a common dinner
plate, well known to be first in the universe.
What majestic treasures are these!&mdash;The sapphires
and rubies beat those of Bavaria, but
the Electress’s pearls at Munich are unrivalled
yet. Saxony is a very rich country in her
own bosom it seems; the agates and jaspers
produced here are excellent, nor are good
amethysts wanting; the topazes are pale and
sickly.</p>

<p>Nothing can be finer, or in its way
more tasteful, than a chimney-piece made for
the Elector, entirely from the manufacture
and produce of his own dominions; that part
which we should form of marble is white
porcelane, with an exquisite bas-relief in the
middle copied from the antique; its sides are
set with Saxon gems, cameowise; and such
carnelions much amaze one in so northern a
latitude; the workmanship is beyond praise.&mdash;I
asked the gentleman who shewed us the
cabinet of natural history, why such richly-coloured
minerals, and even precious stones,
were found in these climates; while every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
animal product grows paler as it approaches
the pole?&mdash;“Where phlogiston is frequent,”
replied he, “there is no danger of the tint
being too lightly bestowed: our quantity of
iron here in Saxony, gives purple to the amethysts
you admire; and see here if the rainbow-stone
of Labrador yields in glowing hue
to the productions of Mexico or Malabar.”&mdash;The
specimens here however were not as valuable
as the conversation of him who has the
care of them; but a <i lang="la">plica Polonica</i> took much
of my attention; the size and weight of it was
enormous, its length four yards and a half;
the person who was killed by its growth was
a Polish lady of quality well known in King
Augustus’s court; it is a very strange and a
very shocking thing!</p>

<p>Our library here is new and not eminently
well stocked; but it is too cold weather now
to stand long looking at rarities. The first
Reformation bible published by Luther himself,
with a portrait of the first Protestant
Elector, is however too curious and interesting
to be neglected; in frost and snow such
sights might warm a heart well disposed to see
the word of God disseminated, which had
lain too long locked up by ignorance and interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
united. Here is a book too, which
how it escaped Pinelli I know not, a Venetian
translation of the holy scriptures <i lang="it">a Brucioli</i>,
the date 1592. King Augustus’s maps please
one from their costliness; the Elector has
twelve volumes of them; every letter is gold,
every city painted in miniature at the corners,
while arms, trophies, &amp;c. adorn the whole,
to an incredible expence: they were engraved
on purpose for his use; and that no other
Prince might ever have such again, he ordered
the plates to be broke.</p>

<p>Sunday, December 17. I am just now returned
home from the Lutheran church of
Notre Dame; where, though the communicants
do not kneel down like us, it is odd
to say I never saw the sacrament administered
with such solemnity and pomp. Four priests
ornamented with a large cross on the back, a
multitude of lighted tapers blazing round
them, a uniformity in the dress of all who
received, and music played in a flat third
somehow very impressively, as they moved
round in a sort of procession, making a profound
reverence to the altar when they passed
it, struck me extremely, who have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
lately accustomed to see very little ceremony
used on <em>such</em> occasions; and I well remember
at Pisa in particular, that while we were looking
about the church for curiosity, one poor
woman knelt down just by us, and a priest
coming out administered the sacrament to her
alone, the whole finishing in less than five
minutes I am persuaded. I said to Mr. Seydelman,
when we had returned home to-day,
that the Saxons seemed to follow the
first manner in reformation, our Anglicans
the second, and the Calvinists the third: he
understood my allusion to the cant of connoisseurship.</p>

<p>The sedan chairs here give the town a sort
of homeish look; I had not been carried
in one since I left Genoa, and it is so comfortable
this cold clear weather! A regular
market too, though not a fine one, has an
English air; and a saddle of mutton, or more
properly a chine, was a sight I had not contemplated
for two years and a half. The
Italians do call a cook <i lang="it">teologo</i>, out of sport;
but I think he would be the properest theologian
in good earnest, to tell why Catholics
and Protestants should not cut their meat alike
at least, if they cannot agree in other points.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
This is the first town I have seen however,
where the butchers divided their beasts as we
do.</p>

<p>The arsenal we have walked over delighted
us but little: Saxons should say to their
swords, like Benvolio in the play, “<cite>God send
me no need of thee!</cite>”&mdash;for the Emperor is on
one side of them, and the King of Prussia on
the other. This last is always mentioned as
a pacific prince though; and the first has so
much to do and to think of, I hope he will
forget Dresden, and suffer them to possess their
fine territory and gems in perfect peace and
quietness. One thing however was odd and
pretty, and worth remarking, That at Rome
there was an arsenal in the church&mdash;I mean
belonging to it; and here there is a church in
the arsenal.</p>

<p>The bombardment of this pretty town by
their active neighbour Frederic; the sweet
Electress’s death in consequence of the personal
mortifications she received during that
dreadful siege; the embarkation of the treasures
to send them safe away by water; and
the various distresses suffered by this city in the
time of that great war;&mdash;make much of our
conversation, and that conversation is interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
I only wonder they have so quickly
recovered a blow struck so hard.</p>

<p>The gaiety and good-humour of the court
are much desired by the Saxons, who have a
most lofty notion of princes, and repeat all
they say, and all that is said of them, with a
most venerating affection. I see no national
partiality to England however, as in many
other parts of Europe, though our religions
are so nearly allied: and here is a spirit of
subordination beyond what I have yet been
witness to&mdash;an aunt kissing the hand of her
own niece (a baby not six years old), and
calling her “<i lang="fr">ma chere comtesse!</i>”&mdash;carried it
as high I think as it can be carried.</p>

<p>The environs of Dresden are happily disposed,
for though it is deep winter we have
had scarcely any snow, and the horizon is very
clear, so that one may be a tolerable judge of
the prospects. Our river Elbe is truly majestic
and the great islands of ice floating
down it have a fine appearance.</p>

<p>They do not double their sash-windows as
at Vienna, but there is less wind to keep out.
In every place people have a trick of lamenting,
and there are two themes of lamentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
universal for aught I see&mdash;the weather and
the poor. I see no beggars here, and feel no
rain,&mdash;but hear heavy complaints of both.
Crying the hour in the night as at London
pleased me much; why the ceremony is accompanied
by the sound of a horn, nobody
seems able to tell. The march of soldiers
morning and night to music through the
streets is likewise agreeable, and gives ideas
of security; but driving great heavy waggons
up and down, with two horses a-breast,
like a chaise in England, and a postillion upon
one of them, is very droll to look at. Ordinary
fellows too in the Elector’s livery (blue
and yellow) would seem strange, but that as
soon as Dover is left behind every man seems
to belong to some other man, and no man to
himself. The Emperor’s livery is very handsome,
but I do not admire <em>this</em>. A custom of
fifteen or twenty grave-looking men, dressed
like counsellors in Westminster Hall, with
half a dozen boys in their company for <i lang="it">sopranos</i>,
singing counterpoint under one’s window,
has an odd effect; they are confraternities
of people I am told, who live in a sort
of community together, are maintained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
contributing friends, and taught music at their
expence; so in order to accomplish themselves,
and shew how well they are accomplished,
this curious contrivance is adopted.
Every Sunday we hear them again in the
church belonging to the parish that maintains
them. A procession of bakers too is a droll
oddity, but shews that where there is much
leisure for the common people, some cheap
amusement must be found: two of these
bakers fight at the corner of every street for
precedence, which by this means often changes
hands; yet does not the conquered baker
shew any signs of shame or depression, nor
does the contest last long, or prove interesting.
I suppose they have settled all the battles beforehand:
no meaning seemed to be annexed
either by performers or spectators to the
show; we could make little diversion out of
it, but have no doubt of its being an old superstition.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve I went to Santa Sophia’s
church, and heard a famous preacher; his
manner was energetic, and he kept an hour-glass
by him, finishing with strange abruptness
the moment it was expired. This was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
use among our distant provinces as late as
Gay’s time; he mentions it in a line of his
pastorals, and says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He preach’d the hour-glass in her praise quite out;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">speaking of dead Blouzelind as I recollect.
It now seems a strange <i lang="fr">grossiereté</i>, but refinement
follows hard upon the heels of reformation.</p>

<p>There is an agreeable fancy here, which
one has always heard of, but never seen
perhaps; the notion of calling together a dozen
pretty children to receive presents upon
Christmas eve. The custom is exceedingly
amiable in itself, and gives beside a pleasing
pretext for parents and relations to meet, and
while away the time till supper in reciprocating
caresses with their babies, and rejoicing in
that species of happiness (the purest of all
perhaps) which childhood alone can either
receive or bestow. I was invited to an exhibition
of this sort, and for some time saw
little preparation for pleasure, except the sight
of fourteen or fifteen well-dressed little creatures,
all under the age of twelve I think, and
more girls than boys: the company consisted
of three or four and twenty people; all spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
French, and I was directed to observe how
the young ones watched for the opening of a
particular door; which however remained
shut so long, that I forgot it again, and had
begun to interest myself in chat with my
nearest neighbour (no mother of course), when
the door flew wide, and the master of the
house announced the hour of felicity, shewing
us an apartment gaily illuminated with coloured
lamps; a sort of tree in grotto-work
adorned the middle, and the presents were
arranged all round; dolls innumerable, variously
adjusted; fine new clothes, fans, trinkets,
work-baskets, little escritoires, purses,
pocket-books, toys, dancing-shoes,&mdash;every
thing. The children skipped about, and capered
with exultation;&mdash;“My own mama!
my dear aunt! my sweet kind grandpapa!”&mdash;resounded
wherever we turned our heads;
I think it was the loveliest little show imaginable,
and am sorry to know how description
must necessarily wrong it: <i lang="fr">les etrennes de
Dresde</i> shall however remain indelibly fixed
in my memory. When the pretty dears had
appropriated and arranged their presents, cake
and lemonade were brought to quiet their agitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
spirits, and all went home happy to bed.
Their sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks served
for our theme till supper-time; and I sat trying,
but in vain, to find a reason why paternal
affection appears so much warmer always
in Protestant countries, and filial piety in
those which remain firm to the church of
Rome.</p>

<p>We returned home to our inn exceedingly
well amused; the supper had been magnificent,
and the preceding fast gave it additional relish.
I now tremble with apprehension however lest
the show of yesterday was too splendid: for if
the mothers begin once to vie with each other
whose gifts shall be grandest, or if once the
friend at whose house the treat is prepared
produces a more costly entertainment than his
neighbours have hitherto contented themselves
with giving, this innocent and even praiseworthy
pastime will soon swell into expensive
luxury, and burst from having been poisoned
by the corroding touch of malice and of envy.</p>

<p>Our Saxons however seemed well-bred,
airy, and agreeable in last night’s hour of festivity;
and could I have fancied their gaiety
quite natural like that of Venice or Verona, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
might perhaps have caught the sweet infection,
and felt disposed to merriment myself; but
much of this was studied mirth one saw, and
pleasure upon principle, as in our own island;
which, though more elegant, is less attractive.
It is difficult to catch the contagion of artificial
hilarity, and a celebrated surgeon once told
me, that one might live with safety at Sutton-house
among the inoculated patients, without
ever taking the disorder, unless the operation
were regularly performed upon one’s self.</p>

<p>Well! we must shortly quit this very comfortable
resting-place, and leave a town more
like our own than any I have yet seen; where,
however, the dresses, of ordinary women I
mean, are extraordinary enough, each when
she is made up for show wearing a rich old-fashioned
brocade cloke lined with green
lutestring, and edged round with narrow fur.
This is universal. Her neat black love-hood
however is not so ugly as the man’s bright
yellow brass comb, stuck regularly in all their
heads of long straight hair who are not people
of fashion; and no powder is ever used
among the Lutherans here in Saxony I see,
except by gentlemen and ladies, who often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
take all <em>theirs</em> out when they go to church,
from some odd principle of devotion. It is
very pretty though to see the little clean-faced
lads and wenches running to school so in a
morning at every protestant town, with the
grammar and testament under their arm,
while every the meanest house has a folio bible
in it, and all the people of the lowest
ranks can read it.</p>

<p>On this 1st of January 1787, I may boast
of having visited lord Peter, Jack, and Martin,
all in the course of one day. Hearing Mons.
Dumarre preach to the French Huguenots in
the morning, attending the established church
at Notre Dame at noon, and going to the
Elector’s truly-magnificent place of worship at
night, where Hasse’s Te Deum was sung, and
executed with prodigious regularity and pomp,
over against an altar decorated with well-employed
splendour, exhibiting zeal for God’s
house, animated by elegant taste, and encouraged
by royal presence;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p>I studied then to keep my mind, I hope I
kept it free from narrow and from vulgar prejudice,
desirous only of seeing the three principal
sects of Christians adoring their Redeemer,
each in the way they think most likely to
please him; nor will I mention which method
had the most immediate effect on <em>me</em>; but this

<p class="noindent">Monsieur Dumarre produced from his peaceful
auditors more tears of gratitude and
tenderness in true remembrance of the sacred
season, than were shed at either of the other
churches. Indeed the sublime and pathetic
simplicity of the place, the truly-touching
rhetoric of the preacher, his story a sad one;
while his persecuted family were forced to fly
their native country, driven thence by the rigour
of Romish severity, and his life exactly
corresponding to the purity of that doctrine he
teaches: his tones of voice, his tranquillity of
manners,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The established sect here&mdash;<em>Lutheranism</em>,
keeps almost the exact medium between the
other two, though their places of worship strike
me as something more theatrical than one
could wish; very stately they are certainly,
and very imposing. As few people however
are fond of a middle state, as here is prodigious
encouragement given by the court to
Romanists, and full toleration from the state
to the disciples of John Calvin, I wonder
more members of the national church do not
quit her communion for that of one of these
chapels, which however owe their very existence
in Saxony to that truly christian and
catholick spirit of toleration, possessed by
Martin alone.</p>

<p>We have recovered ourselves now from all
fatigues; our coach and our spirits are once
more repaired, and ready to set out for</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<h2>BERLIN.</h2>

<p>The road hither is all a heavy sand, cut
through vast forests of ever-green timber, but
not beautiful like those of Bavaria, rather tedious,
flat, and tristful: to encrease which
sensations, and make them more grievous to
us, our servants complained bitterly of the last
long frosty night, which we spent wholly in
the carriage till it brought us here, where the
man of the house, a bad one enough indeed,
speaks as good English as I do, and has lived
long in London. I am not much enchanted
with this place however. Dean Swift said, that
a good style was only proper words in proper
places; and if a good city is to be judged of
in the same way, perhaps Berlin may obtain
the first place, which one would not on an
immediate glance think it likely to deserve; as
a mere residence however, it will be difficult to
find a finer.</p>

<p>He who sighs for the happy union of situation,
climate, fertility, and grandeur, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
think <em>Genoa</em> transcends all that even a warm
imagination can wish. If with a very, very
little less degree of positive beauty, he feels
himself chiefly affected by a number of Nature’s
most interesting features, finely, and
even philosophically arranged; <em>Naples</em> is the
town that can afford him most matter both of
solemn and pleasing speculation.</p>

<p>If ruins of pristine splendour, solid proofs
of universal dominion, <em>once</em>, nay <em>twice</em> enjoyed:
with the view of temporal power crushed
by its own weight, solicits his curiosity.&mdash;It
will be amply gratified at <em>Rome</em>; where all that
modern magnificence can perform, is added
to all that ancient empire has left behind.
Romantic ideas of Armida’s palace, fancied
scenes of perennial pleasure, and magical
images of ever varying delight, will be best realized
at smiling <em>Venice</em> of any place; but if a
city may be called perfect in proportion to its
external convenience, if making many houses
to hold many people, keeping infection away
by cleanliness, and ensuring security against
fire by a nice separation of almost every
building from almost every other; if uniformity
of appearance can compensate for elegance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of architecture, and space make amends
for beauty, <em>Berlin</em> certainly deserves to be
seen, and he who planned it, to be highly commended.
The whole looks at its worst now;
all the churches are in mourning, so are the
coaches: no theatre is open, and no music
heard, except now and then a melancholy
German organ droning its dull round of tunes
under one’s window, without even the London
accompaniment of a hoarse voice crying
<em>Woolfleet oysters</em>. Come! Berlin can boast an
arsenal capable of containing arms for two
hundred and fifty thousand men. The contempt
of decoration for a place destined to real
use seemed respectable in itself, and characteristic
of its founder. No columns of guns
or capitals of pistols, neatly placed, are to be
seen here. A vast, large, clean, cold-looking
room, with swords and muskets laid up only
that they may be taken down, is all one has to
look at in Frederick’s preparations for attack
or defence.</p>

<p>In accumulation of ornaments one hopes to
find elegance, and in rejection of superfluity
there is dignity of sentiment; but nothing can
excuse a sovereign prince for keeping as curiosities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
worthy a traveller’s attention, a heap
of trumpery fit to furnish out the shop of a
Westminster pawnbroker. Our cabinet of
rarities here is literally no better than twenty
old country gentlemen’s seats, situated in the
distant provinces of England, shew to the servants
of a neighbouring family upon a Christmas
visit, when the housekeeper is in good
humour, and, gently wiping the dust off my
<em>late lady’s mother’s</em> amber-boxes, produces
forth the wax figures of my lord John and
my lord Robert when <em>babies</em>. For this pitiable
exhibition, ships cut in paper, and saints
carved in wood, we paid half a guinea each;
not gratuity to the person who has them in
charge, but tax imposed by the government.
Every house here is obliged to maintain so
many soldiers, excepting such and such only
who have the word <em>free</em> written over their
doors; here seem to be no people in the town
almost except soldiers though; so they naturally
command whatever is to be had. Most
nations begin and end with a <em>military</em> dominion,
as red is commonly the first and last colour
obtained by the chymist in his various experiments
upon artificial tints. This state is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
yet young, and many things in it not quite
come to their full growth, so we must not be
rigorous in our judgments. I have seen the
library, in which we were for the first time
shewn what is confidently <em>said</em> to be an Æthiopian
manuscript, and such it certainly may be
for aught I know. What interested me much
more was our Tonson’s <cite>Cæsar</cite>, a book remarkable
for having been written by the first
hero and general in the world perhaps, dedicated
to the second, and possessed by the
third. Here is an exceeding perfect collection
of all Hogarth’s prints.</p>

<p>This city appears to be a very wholesome
one; the houses are not high to confine the
air between them, or drive it forward in currents
upon the principle of Paris or Vienna;
the streets are few, but long, straight, and
wide; ground has not been spared in its construction,
which seems a most judicious one;
and with this well-earned praise I am most
willing to quit it. It is the first place of any
consequence I have felt in a hurry to run away
from; for till now there have been <em>some</em> attractions
in every town; something that commanded
veneration or invited fondness; something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
pleasing in its society, or instructive in
its history. It would however be sullen
enough to feel no agreeable sensation in seeing
this child of the present century come to age
so: the tomb of its author is the object of our
present curiosity, which will be gratified to-morrow.</p>

<h2>POTZDAM.</h2>

<p>And now, if Berlin wants taste and magnificence,
here’s Potzdam built on purpose, I
believe, to shew that even with both a place
may be very dismal and very disagreeable. The
commonest buildings in this city look like the
best side of Grosvenor-square in London, or
Queen’s-square at Bath. I have not seen a
street so narrow as Oxford Road, but many
here are much wider, with canals up the middle,
and a row of trees planted on each side, a
gravel walk near the water for foot passengers,
instead of a <i lang="fr">trottoir</i> by the side of the
houses. Every dwelling is ornamented to a
degree of profusion; but to one’s question of,
“Who lives in these palaces?” one hears that
they are all empty space, or only occupied by
goods never wanted, or corn there is nobody
to feed with: this amazes one; and in fact
here are no inhabitants of dignity at all proportioned
to the residences provided for them;
so that when one sees the copies of antique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
bas-reliefs, in no bad sculpture, decorating the
doors whence dangle a shoulder of mutton,
or a shoemaker’s last, it either shocks one or
makes one laugh, like the old Bartholomew
trick of putting a baby’s face upon an old
man’s shoulders, or sticking a king’s crown
upon a peasant’s head.</p>

<p>The churches are very fine on the outside,
but strangely plain within: that, however, where
the royal body reposes looked solemn and
stately in its mourning dress. Black velvet,
with silver fringe and tassels very rich and
heavy, hung over the pulpit, family seat, &amp;c.
and every thing struck one with an air of melancholy
dignity. The king of Prussia’s corpse,
no longer animated by ambition, rests quietly
in an unornamented solid silver coffin, placed in
a sort of closet above ground, the door to
which opens close to the pulpit’s feet, and
shews the narrow space which now holds his
body, beside that of his father, and the great
elector, as he is still justly called.</p>

<p>My sepulchral tour is now nearly finished:
we have in the course of this journey seen the
last remains of many a celebrated mortal.
Virgil, Raphael, Ariosto, Scipio, Galileo,
Petrarch, Carlo Borromeo, and the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Prussia. How different each from other in
his life! How like each other now! But</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="fr">

<div class="verse">Tous ces morts ont vecu; toi qui lis&mdash;tu mourras:</div>

<p>I could have wished before my return to
have paused a moment on the tomb of Melancthon,
who might be said to have united
in himself <em>their</em> separate perfections. Courage,
genius, moderation, piety! persevering
steadiness in the right way himself; candid
acknowledgment of merit, even in his enemies,
where he saw their intentions right,
though he thought their tenets and their conduct
wrong. But we are removed far from
the dwelling of the <em>peacemaker</em>; let us at least
look at the palace, now we have examined the
coffin of him whose study and delight was <em>war</em>.</p>

<p>Sans Souci is surely an elegantly chosen
spot, its architecture excellent, its furniture
rich yet delicate, the gardens very happily
disposed, the prospect from its windows agreeable,
the pictures within an admirable collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
A hall built in imitation of the Colonna
gallery shews Frederick’s taste at once and liberal
spirit: the front seems borrowed from
something at St. Peter’s; all is beautiful; the
gilding of his long-room makes a very sudden
and strong effect, nor are marbles of immense
value wanting; here is a specimen of every
thing I think, and two agate tables of prodigious
size and beauty. The Silesian chrysopaz,
and Carolina marble of a bright scarlet
colour, quite luminous like the feathers of a
fighting cock, struck me with their singular
and splendid appearance. Rubens’s merit was
not new to me, I hope; yet here is a resurrection
of Lazarus, in which he has been lavish
of it. The composition of this picture seems
to have been intended to surpass every thing
put together by other artists: its colouring
glows like life.</p>

<p>The king’s town-house, however, is finer far
than this his villa was designed to be; but I
grew very tired walking over it: when one has
dragged through twenty-four rooms variously
hung with pink and silver, green and gold, &amp;c.
one grows cruelly weary with repeating the same
ideas by drawling through forty-eight more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
I wished to see his own private living apartments,
and to mind with what books and
pictures he adorned the dressing-room he always
sate in: the first were chiefly works of
Voltaire and Metastasio&mdash;the last were small
landscapes of Albano and Watteau. At our
desire they shewed us the little bed he slept,
the chairs he sate in familiarly. Suetonius in
French and Italian was the last author he
looked into; they have made a mark at the
death of Augustus, where he was reading
when the same visitant called on him, quite
unexpected by himself it seems, though all
his attendants were well aware of his approach.
As he expired he said, <cite>I give you a
vast deal of trouble</cite>. We saw the spot he sate
in at the moment; for Frederick no more
died in his bed, than did the famous Flavius
Vespasian; his servants wept as they repeated
the particulars, caressing while they spoke
his favourite dogs, one of which, a terrier,
could hardly be prevailed upon to quit the
body. It used to amuse the king to see them
frighted when he would take them to a long
room lined with French mirrors, which he
did now and then to laugh at the effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Every thing at Potzdam shews a man in
haste to enjoy what he had laboured so hard
to procure; nor did he ever refuse himself,
they say, any gratification that could make
age less wearisome, or illness less afflictive.
He had much taste of English ingenuity&mdash;combinations
of convenience, and improvements
in mechanism: his own writing-table,
however, was contrived by himself; it stands
on four legs, one pair longer than the other
to make it slope; the covering is green velvet,
with a square hole for the standish to drop
in and not spill the ink: I liked the device
exceedingly, but wondered he thought any
device worth his preference. His conversation
to his servants was affable and even gay; they
loved his person, it is plain, and half adore
his memory.</p>

<p>Such were the manners then, and such the
death, of the far-famed philosopher of Sans
Souci! And in truth, when he had so often
set all present and future happiness to hazard,
it would have been inconsistent not to hasten
the enjoyment: nobody comes to inhabit his
fine town, however, which has much the look
of buildings in a stage perspective. Soldiers
only, and such as sell wares necessary to soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
were all the human creatures I could
see here; nor are families, or travellers of any
sort indeed, better accommodated here than
at inns of less pompous appearance on the
outside.</p>

<p>For accommodations, however, I care but
little; I have now walked over the oldest and
the youngest cities in all Europe, and have
left each with sincere admiration of their contents.
Both are full of buildings and empty
of inhabitants, nor am I desirous to add to
the number in either. I was going to step
forward into some room of the palace yesterday&mdash;“Madam,
come back this instant,” exclaimed
our Cicerone; “if that chamber is entered,
my head will be off my shoulders in
three days time.” Another well attested anecdote
may be worth relating: A gentleman
with whom we passed an agreeable evening at
Berlin, whose lady invited to meet us whatever
was most charming in the town, told the
following story of a soldier who, being desirous
of his body’s dissolution, but fearful of
his soul’s rushing unprepared into eternity,
caught and murdered a six months old baby;
giving this strange account of his own feelings
on the occasion, and adding, that he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
like to kill an adult, lest his own impatience
of life’s insupportable torment might by that
means precipitate his neighbour to perdition;
but that a baptized infant would be sure of
heaven, and he himself should gain time to
prepare for following it&mdash;“And, Lord!” said my
informer, “what reasoners this world has in it!”
The soldier was hanged six weeks after the
dreadful crime was committed; he made a
very decent and penitential end.</p>

<p>On such facts what observations or reflections
can result? I made none, but gave God
thanks that I was born a subject of Great
Britain.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="smcap">POTZDAM to HANOVER.</span></h2>

<p>On the 13th of January 1787 then we
quitted Potzdam, strongly impressed by the
beauties of a town apparently fabricated by a
modern Cadmus, who, when all the soldiers
that he could <em>raise</em> were fallen in <em>battle</em> for his
amusement, retired with the five that were
left, and built a fine city!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Brandenbourg was our next resting place,
and seemed to me to merit a longer stay in it;
I saw an old Runick figure in the street, its
size colossal, and its composition seemed black
basalt; but of this I could obtain no account
for want of language, our still recurring torment.&mdash;This
place seems fuller of inhabitants
than the last; but it is <em>so</em> melancholy to have
no compensation for the fatigues of a tedious
journey! and in these countries information
cannot be procured for travellers that do not
mean to reside, present letters, &amp;c.; which
task we have at this season little taste to renew.</p>

<p>Magdebourg makes a respectable appearance
at a distance, from the loftiness of its
turrets; one sees them at least four long hours
before the roads which lead to it permit one’s
approach; and the towers seem to retire before
one, like Ulysses’s fictitious country raised
to deceive him. Never was I so weary in my
life as when we entered Magdebourg, where,
instead of going out to see sights as usual, I
desired nothing so sincerely as a hot supper
and soft bed, which the inns of Germany never
fail to afford us in even elegant perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Our linen too, so beautifully, and I will add
so unnecessarily fine! The king of Naples
probably never saw such sheets and table-cloths
as we have been comforted with here, not only
at Dresden, but every post since.</p>

<p>Magdebourg seems to have almost all its
streets united by bridges; the Elbe divides
there into so many branches, and none of them
small.</p>

<p>Helmstadt is a little place which affords few
images to the mind, and Brunswick to mere
passengers, as we were, seemed to yield none
but sad ones. The houses all of wood, even to
prince Ferdinand’s palace, and painted of a dull
olive colour with heavy pensile roofs, giving
the town a melancholy look; but we met
with young Englishmen who commended the
society, and said no place could be gayer than
Brunswick. This is among the reports one
wishes to be true, and we are led the more
willingly to believe them.</p>

<p>Another delight which I enjoyed at this
city was, to find that every body in it, and
every body passing through it, adored the
duchess, whose partial fondness, and tender
remembrance of her native country, justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
endears her name to every subject of Great
Britain. Her chapel is pretty; the garden,
where they said she always walked two hours
every day, put me in mind of Gray’s-Inn
walks twenty or thirty years ago; they were
then very like it.</p>

<p>From these scenes of solitude without retirement,
and of age without antiquity, I was
willing enough to be gone; but they would
shew me one curiosity they said, as I seemed
to feel particular pleasure in speaking of their
charming duchess. We followed, and were
shewn <em>her coffin!</em> all in silver, finely carved,
chased, engraved, what you will. “Before
she is dead!” exclaimed I&mdash;“Before she was
even married, madam,” replied our Cicerone;
“it is the very finest ever made in Brunswick;
we had it ready for her against she came home
to us, and you see the plate left vacant for
her age.” I was glad to drive forward now,
and slept at Peina; which, though in itself
a miserable place, exhibits one consolatory
sight for a Christian&mdash;the sight of toleration.
Here Romanists, Lutherans, and Calvinists,
live all affectionately and quietly together,
under the protection of the bishop of Paderborne;
and here I first saw the king of England’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
livery upon the king of England’s servants
since I left home&mdash;“And if they <em>are</em> ragged
youngsters who wear it,” said I, “they are
my fellow-subjects, and glad am I to see
them!”</p>

<p>The villages and churches hereabouts resemble
those of Merionethshire, only that not
a mountain rears its head at all&mdash;one vast,
wide, barren flat, through which roads that
no weather can render better than barely passable
brought us at length to Hanover, which
stands, as all these cities do in the north of
Germany, upon an immense plain, with a
thick wood of noble timber trees breaking
from time to time the almost boundless void,
and relieving the eye, which is fatigued by
extent without any object to repose upon, in
a manner I can with difficulty comprehend,
much less explain; but the sight of a passing
waggon, or distant spire, is a felicity seldom
found, though continually sought by me,
while travelling through these wide wasted
countries, where no idea is afforded to the
imagination, no image remitted to the mind,
but that of two armies encountering each
other, to dispute the plunder of some place
already unable to feed its few inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The horses however are exceedingly beautiful;
we were offered a pair of very fine ones for
only forty pounds. They would have run such
hazards getting home! “There are two ways to
chuse out of,” said I; “if we purchase them,
we shall repent on it every day till we arrive in
London; if we do not, we shall repent on it
every day after we get there.” Such is life!
we did not buy the cattle.</p>

<p>The cleanliness of the windows, the manner
of paving and lighting the streets at
Hanover, put us in mind a little of some country
towns in the remoter provinces of England;
and there seems to be likewise a little glimpse
of British manners, dress, &amp;c. breaking through
the common and natural fashions of the
country. This was very pleasing to us, but
I wished the place grander; I do not very well
know why, but we had long counted on comforts
here as at home, and I had formed expectations
of something much more magnificent
than we found; though the Duke of
York’s residence does give the town an air
of cheerfulness it scarce could shew without
that advantage; and here are concerts and
balls, and efforts at being gay, which may
probably succeed sometime. How did all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the talk however, and all the pamphlets, and
all the lamentations made by old King George’s
new subjects, rush into my mind, when I
recollected the loud, illiberal, and indecent
clamours made from the year 1720 to the year
1750, at least till the alarm given by the
Rebellion began to operate, and open people’s
eyes to the virtues of the reigning family! for
till then, no topic had so completely engrossed
both press and conversation, as the misfortunes
accruing to <em>poor</em> old England, from their
King’s desire of enriching his Electoral
dominions, and feeding his favourite Hanoverians
with their good guineas, making fat the
objects of his partial tenderness with their
best treasures&mdash;in good time! Such groundless
charges remind one of a story the famous
French wit Monsieur de Menage tells of his
mother and her maid, who, having wasted or
sold a pound of butter, laid the theft upon
the <em>cat</em>, persisting so violently that it had been
all devoured by the rapacious favourite, that
Madame de Menage said, “It’s very well;
we will weigh the cat, poor thing! and know
the truth:” The scales were produced, but
puss could be found to weigh only <em>three quarters</em>,
after all her depredations.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">From HANOVER to BRUSSELS.</span></h2>

<p>Travelling night and day through the
most dismal country I ever yet beheld, brought
us at length to Munster, where we had a good
inn again, and talked English. Well may
all our writers agree in celebrating the miseries
of Westphalia! well may they, while the
wretched inhabitants, uniting poverty with
pride, live on their hogs, with their hogs, and
like their hogs, in mud-walled cottages, a
dozen of which together is called by courtesy
a village, surrounded by black heaths, and
wild uncultivated plains, over which the unresisted
wind sweeps with a velocity I never
yet was witness to, and now and then, exasperated
perhaps by solitude, returns upon itself
in eddies terrible to look on. Well, the woes
of mortal man are chiefly his own fault; war
and ambition have depopulated the country,
which otherwise need not I believe be poor,
as here is capability enough, and the weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
though stormy, is not otherwise particularly
disagreeable. January is no mild month any
where; even Naples, so proverbially delicious,
is noisy enough with thunder and lightning;
and the torrents of rain which often fall at
this season at Rome and Florence, make them
unpleasing enough. Nor do I believe that
the <em>very</em> few people one finds here are of a
lazy disposition at all; but it is so seldom that
one meets with the <em>human face divine</em> in this
Western side of Germany, that one scarce
knows what they are, but by report.</p>

<p>The town of Munster is catholic I see;
their cathedral heavily and clumsily adorned,
like the old Lutheran church called Santa
Sophia at Dresden. One pair of their silver
candlesticks however are eight feet high, and
exhibit more solidity than elegance. They
told us something about the <em>three kings</em>, who
must have lost their way amazingly if ever
they wandered into Westphalia, and deserved
to lose their name of <em>wise men</em> too, I think.
We were likewise shewn the sword worn by
St. Paul, they told us, and a backgammon
table preserved behind the high altar, I could
not for, my life find out why; at first our interpreter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
told us, that the man said it had belonged
to <em>John the Baptist</em>, but on further enquiry
we understood him that it was once
used by some Anabaptists; as that seemed no
less wild a reason for keeping it there, than
the other seemed as an account of its original,
we came away uninformed.</p>

<p>Of the reason why Hams are better here
than in any other part of Europe, it was not
so difficult to obtain the knowledge, and the
inquiry was much more useful.</p>

<p>Poor people here burn a vast quantity of
very fine old oak in their cottages, which,
having no chimney, detain the smoke a long
time before it makes its escape out at the door.
This smoke gives the peculiar flavour to that
bacon which hangs from the roof, already fat
with the produce of the same tree growing
about these districts in a plenty not to be believed.
Indeed the sole decoration of this
devasted country is the large quantity of majestic
timber trees, almost all oak, living to
such an age, and spreading their broad arms
with such venerable dignity, that it is <em>they</em>
who appear the ancient possessors of the land,
who, in the true style of Gothic supremacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
suck all the nutriment of it to themselves, only
shaking off a few acorns to content the immediate
hunger of the animal race, which
here seems in a state of great degeneracy indeed,
compared to those haughty vegetables.</p>

<p>This day I saw a fryar; the first that has
crossed my sight since we left the town of Munich
in Bavaria. On the road to Dusseldorp one
sees the country mend at every step; but
even <em>I</em> can perceive the language harsher, the
further one is removed from Hanover on
either side: for Hanover, as Madame de Bianconi
told me at Dresden, is the Florence of
Germany; and the tongue spoken at that
town is supposed, and justly, the criterion of
perfect <em>Teutsch</em>.</p>

<p>The gallery of paintings here shall delay
us but two or three days; I am so very weary
of living on the high roads of <em>Teuchland</em> all
winter long! Gerard Dow’s delightful
mountebank ought, however, to have two of
those days devoted to him, and here is the
most capital Teniers which the world has to
show. Jaques Jordaens never painted any
thing so well as the feast in this gallery, where
there are likewise some wonderful Sckalkens;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
besides Rembrandt’s portrait of himself much
out of repair, and old Franck’s Seven Acts of
Mercy varnished up, as well as the martyrdoms
representing some of the persecutions in
early times of Christianity; these might be
called the Seven Acts of Cruelty&mdash;a duplicate
of the picture may be seen at Vienna. When
one has mentioned the Vanderwerfs, which
are all sisters, and the demi-divine Carlo Dolce
in the window, representing the infant
Jesus with flowers, full of sweetness and innocent
expression, it will be time to talk of
the General Judgment, painted with astonishing
hardihood by Rubens, and which we
stopt here chiefly to see. The second Person
of the Trinity is truly sublime, and formed
upon an idea more worthy of him, at least
more correspondent to the general ideas than
that in Cappella Sestini; where a beholder is
tempted to think on Julius Cæsar somehow,
instead of Jesus Christ&mdash;a Conqueror, more
than a Saviour of mankind.</p>

<p>St. Michael’s figure is incomparable; those of
Moses and St. Peter happily imagined; the spirit
of composition, the manner of grouping and
colouring, the general effect of the whole,
prodigious! I know not why he has so fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
below himself in the Madonna’s character;
perhaps not imitating Tintoret’s lovely Virgin
in Paradise, he has done worse for fear of
being servile. Tintoret’s idea of her is so <em>very</em>
poetical! but those who shewed it me at Venice
said the drawing was borrowed from
Guariento, I remember.</p>

<p>Who however except Rubens would have
thought so justly, so liberally, so wisely, about
the Negro drawn up to heaven by the angels?
who still retains the old terrestrial character, so
far as to shew a disposition to laugh at <em>their</em>
situation who on earth tormented him. When
all is said, every body knows very well that
Michael Angelo’s picture on this subject is by
far the finest; and that neither Rubens nor Tintoret
ever pretended, or even hoped to be
thought as great artists as he: but though Dante
is a sublimer poet than Tasso, and Milton a
writer of more eminence than Pope, <em>these</em> last
will have readers, reciters, and quoters, while
the others must sit down contented with silent
veneration and acknowledged superiority.</p>

<p>This day we saw the Rhine&mdash;what rivers
these are! and what enormous inhabitants they
do contain! a brace of bream, and eels of a magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and flavour very uncommon except in
Germany, were our supper here. But the
manners begin I see to fade away upon the
borders; our soft feather beds are left behind;
men too, sometimes sad, nasty, ill-looked
fellows, come in one’s room to sweep, &amp;c. and
light the fire in the stove, which is now always
made of lead, and the fumes are very
offensive; no more tight maids to be seen:
but we shall get good roads; at Liege, down
in a dirty coal pit, the bad ones end I think;
and that town may be said to finish all our
difficulties. After passing through our last
disagreeable resting-place then, one finds the
manners take a tint of France, and begins to
see again what one has often seen before.
The forests too are fairly left behind, but neat
agriculture, and comfortable cottages more than
supply their loss. Broom, juniper, every
English shrub, announce our proximity to Great
Britain, while pots of mazerion in flower at
the windows shew that we are arrived in a
country where spring is welcomed with ceremony,
as well as received with delight. The
forwardness of the season is indeed surprising;
though it freezes at night now and then, the
general feel of the air is very mild; willows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
already give signs of resuscitation, while flights
of yellowhammers, a bird never observed in
Italy I think, enliven the fields, and look as if
they expected food and felicity to be near.</p>

<p>Louvaine would have been a place well
worth stopping at, they tell me; but we were
in haste to finish our journey and arrive at</p>

<hr />

<h2>BRUSSELS.</h2>

<p>Every step towards this comfortable city
lies through a country too well known to need
description, and too beautiful to be ever described
as it deserves. <i lang="fr">Les Vues de Flandres</i>
are bought by the English, admired by the
Italians, and even esteemed by the French,
who like few things out of their own nation;
but these places once belonged to Louis Quatorze,
and the language has taken such root
it will never more be eradicated. Here are
very fine pictures in many private hands; Mr.
Danot’s collection does not want me to celebrate
its merits; and here is a lovely park,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
and a pleasing coterie of English, and a very
gay carnival as can be, people running about
the streets in crowds; but their theatre is a
vile one: after Italy, it will doubtless be difficult
to find masques that can amuse, or theatres
that can strike one. But never did nation
possess a family more charming than that of
<i lang="fr">La Duchesse d’Arenberg</i>, who, graced with
every accomplishment of mind and person,
devotes her time and thoughts wholly to the
amusement of her amiable consort, calling
round them all which has any power of alleviating
his distressful condemnation to perpetual
darkness, from an accident upon a
shooting party that cost him his sight about
six or seven years ago. Mean time her arm
always guides, her elegant conversation always
soothes him; and either from <i lang="fr">gaieté de cœur</i>,
philosophical resolution to bear what heaven
ordains without repining, or a kind desire of
corresponding with the Duchess’s intentions,
he appears to lose no pleasure himself, nor
power of pleasing others, by his misfortune;
but dances, plays at cards, chats with his
English friends, and listens delightedly (as
who does not?) when charming Countess Cleri
sings to the harpsichord’s accompaniment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
with all Italian taste, and all German execution.
By the Duke D’Aremberg we were
introduced to Prince Albert of Saxony, and
the Princesse Gouvernante, whose resemblance
to her Imperial brother is very striking; her
hand however, so eminently beautiful, is to
be kissed no more; the abolition of that ceremony
has taken place in all the Emperor’s
family. The palace belonging to these princes
is so entirely in the English taste, with pleasure
grounds, shrubbery, lawn, and laid out
water, that I thought myself at home, not
because of the polite attentions received, for
those I have found <em>abroad</em>, where no merits
of mine could possibly have deserved, nor no
services have purchased them. Spontaneous
kindness, and friendship resulting merely from
that innate worth that loves to energize its
own affections on an object which some circumstances
had casually rendered interesting,
are the lasting comforts I have derived from
a journey which has shewn me much variety,
and impressed me with an esteem of many
characters I have been both the happier and
the wiser for having known. Such were the
friends I left with regret, when, crossing the
Tyrolese Alps, I sent my last kind wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
back to the dear state of Venice in a sigh;
such too were my emotions, when we took
leave last night at Lady Torrington’s; and
resolving to quit Brussels to-morrow for Antwerp,
determined to exchange the brilliant
conversation of a <em>Boyle</em>, for the glowing pencil
of a <em>Rubens</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ANTWERP.</h2>

<p>This is a dismal heavy looking town&mdash;<em>so</em>
melancholy! the Scheld shut up! the grass
growing in the streets! those streets so empty
of inhabitants! and it was so famous once.
<i lang="la">Atuatum nobile Brabantiæ opidum in ripâ Schaldis flu.
Europæ nationibus maximè frequentatum.
Sumptuosis tam privatis quam publicis
nitet ædificiis</i><a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, say the not very old books of
geography when speaking of this once stately
city;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">As ocean heaves the labour’d mole away.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>And surely if the empire of Rome is actually
fled away into air like a dream, the opulence
of Antwerp may well crumble to earth
like a clod. What defies time is genius; and
of that, many and glorious proofs are yet left
behind in this place. The composition of a
picture painted to adorn the altar under which
lies buried that which was mortal of its artist,
is beyond all meaner praise. The figure of St.
George might stand by that of Corregio, and suffer
no diminution of one’s esteem. The
descent from the cross too!&mdash;Well! if Daniel
de Volterra’s is more elegantly pathetic, Rubens
has put <em>his</em> pathos in a properer place.&mdash;The
blessed Virgin Mary ought to be but the
second figure certainly in a scene which represents
our almighty Saviour himself completing
the redemption of all mankind. But here
is another devotional piece, highly poetical,
almost dramatic, representing Christ descending
in anger to consume a guilty world. The
globe at a distance low beneath his feet, his
pious mother prostrate before him, covering
part of it with her robe, and deprecating the divine
wrath in a most touching manner. St.
Sebastian shewing his wounds with an air of
the tenderest supplication; Carlo Borromæo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
beseeching in heaven for those fellow-creatures
he ceased not loving or serving while on earth;
and St. Francis in the groupe, but surely ill-chosen;
as he who left the world, and planned
only his own salvation by retirement from its
cares and temptations, would be unlikely
enough to intreat for its longer continuance:
his dress however, so favourable to painters,
was the reason he was pitched upon I trust, as
it affords a particularly happy contrast to the
cardinal’s robes of St. Carlo.</p>

<p>I will finish my reflections upon painting
here, and apologize for their frequency only
by confessing my fondness for the art; and my
conviction, that had I said nothing of that
art in a journey through Italy and Germany,
where so much of every traveller’s attention is
led to mention it, I should have been justly
blamed for affectation; while being censured
for impertinence disgusts me less of the two.
What I have learned from the Italians is a
maxim more valuable than all my stock of
connoisseurship: <i lang="it">Che c’è in tutto il suo bene, e
il suo male</i>&mdash;that <em>there is much of evil and of
good in every thing</em>: and the life of a traveller
evinces the truth of that position perhaps more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
than any other. So persuaded, we made a
bold endeavour to cross the Scheld; but the
wind was so outrageously high, no boat was
willing to venture till towards night: at that
hour “<i lang="la">Unus, et hic audax</i><a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>,” as Leander says,
offered his service to convey us; but the
passage of the Rhine had been so rough before,
that I felt by no means disposed to face
danger again just at the close of the battle.</p>

<p>When we find a disposition to talk over our
adventures, the great ice islands driving down
<i lang="la">Rhenus ferox</i>, as Seneca justly calls it, and
threatening to run against and destroy our
awkward ill-contrived boat, may divert care
over a winter’s fire, some evening in England,
by recollection of past perils. I thought it a
dreadful one at the time; and have no taste
to renew a like scene for the sake of crossing
the Scheld, and arriving a very few moments
sooner than returning through Brussels will
bring us&mdash;<i lang="fr">a la Place de</i></p>

<h2>LILLE;</h2>

<p>Where every thing appears to me to be
just like England, at least just by it; and
in fact four and twenty hours would carry us
thither with a fair wind: and now it really
does feel as if the journey were over; and
even in that sensation, though there is some
pleasure, there is some pain too;&mdash;the time
and the places are past;&mdash;and I have only left
to wish, that my improvements of the one,
and my accounts of the others, were better;
for though Mr. Sherlock comforts his followers
with the kind assertion, That if a hundred
men of parts travelled over Italy, and
each made a separate book of what <em>he</em> saw and
observed, a hundred excellent compositions
might be made, of which no two should be
alike, yet all new, all resembling the original,
and all admirable of their kind.&mdash;One’s constantly-recurring
fear is, lest the readers should
cry out, with Juliet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yea, but all this did I know before!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>
<p>How truly might they say so, did I mention
the oddity (for oddity it still is) in this town
of Lille, to see dogs drawing in carts as beasts
of burden, and lying down in the market-place
when their work is done, to gnaw the
bones thrown them by their drivers: they are
of mastiff race seemingly, crossed by the bull-dog,
yet not quarrelsome at all. This is a
very awkward and barbarous practice however,
and, as far as I know, confined to this city;
for in all others, people seem to have found
out, that horses, asses, and oxen are the proper
creatures to draw wheel carriages&mdash;except
indeed at Vienna, where the streets are
so very narrow, that the men resolve rather to
be harnessed than run over.</p>

<p>How fine I thought these churches thirteen
years ago, comes now thirteen times a-day
into my head; they are not fine at all; but
it was the first time I had ever crossed the
channel, and I thought every thing a wonder,
and fancied we were arrived at the world’s
end almost; so differently do the self-same
places appear to the self-same people surrounded
by different circumstances! I now feel as if
we were at Canterbury. Was one to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Egypt, the sight of Naples on the return
home would probably afford a like sensation
of proximity: and I recollect, one of the gentlemen
who had been with Admiral Anson
round the world told us, that when he came
back as near as our East India settlements, he
considered the voyage as finished, and all his
toils at an end&mdash;so is my little book; and
(if Italy may be considered, upon Sherlock’s
principle, as a sort of academy-figure set up
for us all to draw from) my design of it may
have a chance to go in the portfolio with the
rest, after its exhibition-day is over.</p>

<p>With regard to the general effect travelling
has upon the human mind, it is different with
different people. Brydone has observed, that
the magnetic needle loses her habits upon the
heights of Ætna, nor ever more regains her
partiality for the <em>north</em>, till again newly
touched by the loadstone: it is so with many
men who have lived long from home; they
find, like Imogen,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That there’s living out of Britain;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and if they return to it after an absence of
several years, bring back with them an alienated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
mind&mdash;this is not well. Others there
are, who, being accustomed to live a considerable
time in places where they have not
the smallest intention to fix for ever, but on
the contrary firmly resolve to leave <em>sometime</em>,
learn to treat the world as a man treats his
mistress, whom he likes well enough, but has
no design to marry, and of course never provides
for&mdash;this is not well neither. A third
set gain the love of hurrying perpetually from
place to place; living familiarly with all, but
intimately with none; till confounding their
own ideas (still undisclosed) of right and
wrong, they learn to think virtue and vice
ambulatory, as Browne says; profess that
climate and constitution regulate men’s actions,
till they try to persuade their companions
into a belief most welcome to themselves,
that the will of God in one place is by
no means his will in another; and most resemble
in their whirling fancies a boy’s top I
once saw shewn by a professor who read us a
lecture upon opticks; it was painted in regular
stripes round like a narrow ribbon, red,
blue, green, and yellow; we set it a-spinning
by direction of our philosopher, who, whipping
it merrily about, obtained as a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
effect the total privation of all the four colours,
so distinct at the beginning of its <em>tour</em>;&mdash;<em>it
resembled a dirty white!</em></p>

<p>With these reflexions and recollections we
drove forward to Calais, where I left the
following lines at our inn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Over mountains, rivers, vallies,</div>
<div class="verse">Here are we return’d to Calais;</div>
<div class="verse">After all their taunts and malice,</div>
<div class="verse">Ent’ring safe the gates of Calais;</div>
<div class="verse">While, constrain’d, our captain dallies,</div>
<div class="verse">Waiting for a wind at Calais,</div>
<div class="verse">Muse! prepare some sprightly sallies</div>
<div class="verse">To divert <i lang="fr">ennui</i> at Calais.</div>
<div class="verse">Turkish ships, Venetian gallies,</div>
<div class="verse">Have we seen since last at Calais;</div>
<div class="verse">But tho’ Hogarth (rogue who rallies!)</div>
<div class="verse">Ridicules the French at Calais,</div>
<div class="verse">We, who’ve walk’d o’er many a palace,</div>
<div class="verse">Quite well content return to Calais;</div>
<div class="verse">For, striking honestly the tallies,</div>
<div class="verse">There’s little choice ’twixt them and Calais.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It would have been graceless not to give
these lines a companion on the other side the
water, like Dean Swift’s distich before and
after he climbed Penmanmaur: these verses
were therefore written, and I believe still remain,
in an apartment of the Ship inn:</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
